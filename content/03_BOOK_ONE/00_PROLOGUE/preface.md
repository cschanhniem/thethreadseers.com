# Acknowledgments

This book exists because of threads, quiet and stubborn, that bind me to those I love most.

To my parents, who believed from the beginning. Your support became my strongest thread.

To Katie, my partner in every adventure: thank you for standing beside me through challenge and celebration alike.

To Mia and Lana, my brilliant daughters who teach me to see the world through wonder-struck eyes; your curiosity, creativity, and joy are woven into every page. May you follow the silver threads of your dreams, wherever they lead.

And to you, dear reader, for lifting this book and joining the thread that connects us through story. Welcome to the Weave.
