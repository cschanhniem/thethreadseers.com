# PROLOGUE: SAIGON, 1943

The bullet cut the air past Mei-Hua's ear.
She didn't flinch.

The threads had warned her a heartbeat earlier: a violent red line from rooftop to trigger, intention to consequence.

Mei-Hua pressed deeper into warehouse shadows, air thick with damp sacking and old metal. Her brother's last words haunted her: *"If the Japanese shipping manifest reaches Tokyo, a thousand families in Chợ Lớn will starve this winter."* Three months since his disappearance, and the threads that once held them together still hung broken and dark.

Below, Japanese soldiers patrolled the quays along the Saigon River. Boots on cobblestone. Rifles in hand. To ordinary eyes: men with guns. To Mei-Hua: bodies trailing filament, fear and duty braided tight.

Under those threads, Hậu Giang's currents ran heavier than water. Her grandmother had taught her to listen for them: the soul of a street, the gathered life of a community. Tonight the currents dragged, thick with hunger and sorrow, and still they sparked with refusal.

A street remembers.
Not the way a person remembers: no images, no narrative, no neat beginning and end. The way a riverbed remembers a flood: as shape.
As altered capacity.
As a groove worn by a thousand ordinary days of carrying each other.

Mei-Hua could feel where the currents used to run full: markets that had fed three blocks, kitchens that had kept extra rice in the tin for the neighbor who came late, alleys where arguments ended in bowls set down and doors left unlatched.
Now those same routes felt tightened around absence, the way muscle tightens around a bruise.
The buildings still stood.
The lanterns still lit.
But the current underneath had been thinned, siphoned, starved, not only by missing food, but by missing trust.

The occupiers understood this.
Starve the current and you didn't have to shoot every body.
Neighbors would begin to hoard. Then to lie. Then to listen at doors.
The street would start spending itself on fear until even a full bowl tasted like debt.

Mei-Hua closed her eyes and steadied her breath.
In through the nose, hold for three heartbeats, out through parted lips.

When she opened her eyes, the world layered itself again.
Silk threads, bright against the dark. Currents underneath, older and slower.

The Japanese headquarters pulsed with control. Sickly yellow-green filaments stretched across Saigon like a net; currents that should have fed markets and kitchens snagged and bled away. The rice lines from the Mekong Delta ran strained and thin.

And there, just as intelligence from the Cochinchina General Association had warned, a black-silver cord ran from headquarters to a cargo ship moored at port.
Not a passive connection, but a conduit: active and hungry.

"Do you see it? The threads, the… disturbances?" Zhang whispered beside her.

"Yes," Mei-Hua said. "Stolen goods. Strategic materials. It's carrying more than rice."

She traced it and remembered another thread: a green line from her father's calligraphy brush to forged merchant licenses, steady as a pulse under paper, helping refugee families settle in Chợ Lớn. Thread-work could feed life. It could also starve it.

"And?" Zhang asked.

"There's a hand in it." Mei-Hua swallowed. The pattern was too precise, too familiar. "It looks like Dr. Weber."

"The German researcher? Your grandmother's student?"

Mei-Hua nodded once. "Before the war, he understood the balance. Then Berlin recalled him. His letters changed. After that it was quotas, routes, and what could be taken."

This cord carried his signature: methodical, surgical.
And cold.

"We have fifteen minutes before the patrol returns," Zhang said, checking his watch.

Mei-Hua reached into her jacket and drew out her silk pouch, worn smooth under her thumb. Inside: tools that had outlived dynasties. A jade needle. A red silk charm knotted into a pattern that meant choices you couldn't untie.

She heard her grandmother's voice, clear enough to place at her shoulder.

"Sometimes the Western ways have wisdom too. Know when to apply precision," she'd said, lifting the needle, "and when to trust the currents to show the way."

Mei-Hua chose the jade needle and a spool of red silk thread, soaked in herbs and one drop of her blood under the last full moon.

"Keep watch," she whispered to Zhang.

Then she worked.

She didn't cut the black-silver cord. That would ring every alarm in the currents. Instead she braided her red silk alongside it and coaxed a fork: the information would still flow to the harbor, but an echo would travel with her thread to the resistance.

*Silk Vision is not domination, but conversation,* her grandmother had said. *We do not break the threads. We persuade them. The space between two threads is not emptiness. It is the agreement that makes both real. And we listen to the place, because it remembers.*

Sweat traced Mei-Hua's temple despite the night's cool.
Delicate work. Quick work. One mistake and the street itself would scream.

The Japanese had their own thread-walkers, likely German-trained. They called the threads "Anima Filaments" and treated them like wiring.

The black-silver cord pulsed.
A discordant ripple ran through the nearby currents.

Mei-Hua froze.
"Someone's coming."

She secured the final knot, near-invisible.

A familiar resonance brushed the edge of her senses.

"No," she breathed. "It can't be."

Zhang tensed. "What is it?"

"His touch," she whispered. "Like Weber. But twisted."

Footsteps on a roofline.
A presence leaning into the cord she had just altered.

"We need to warn the elders," Mei-Hua said. She had bitten the inside of her cheek hard enough to taste blood and kept her voice level anyway. "These machines, these methodologies, they're pulling too much, too quickly."

"First we finish this," Zhang said. "Then we warn them."

Mei-Hua nodded and followed him into darkness.

Just before they turned the corner, she looked back.

A figure stood on the warehouse roof: tall, European, familiar in outline.

"Weber," she breathed.

The threads connecting them flared with recognition.
The currents around him did not.

They felt wrong, distorted, like a beloved melody forced into a dead key.

The threads belonged to no one.
The currents belonged to the communities they nurtured.

Around Weber, the currents pulled away.
