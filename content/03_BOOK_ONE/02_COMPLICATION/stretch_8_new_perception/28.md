# Chapter 28: The Summons & The Descent

A thread-construct formed above Lyra's cot, unfolded itself into words, and dissolved before she could reach for it.

In the hall, corridor lights pulsed a tired amber-red and the floor hummed under Lyra's bare feet, the building running hot and uneven, but the message didn't bother with numbers.

> Come alone.
>
> Sub-level 7.
>
> Your father's life depends on it.
>
> - H

Lyra stared at the empty air where the letters had been.

The silver thread in her chest tightened, not warning this time but direction.

She thought of Wei's voice that morning: *I can't protect you by refusing reality anymore.*
She thought of the vow in her friends' hands: no solos.

And she thought of the only leverage Harlow had left that could still break her: her father.

Lyra swung her legs over the cot and stood.
The room pitched for half a second as the building's lock cycle clicked.
In the hallway, staff moved past with faces set to functional neutrality.
The Academy had learned how to look calm while it burned.

Lyra walked to the door, hand on the handle, and stopped.

Going alone would make the trap easier to close and the record easier to erase.

She turned and woke Milo first.

He came up blinking and irritable until he saw her face.
"What?"

Lyra told him.

Milo read the air like it might still hold the words.
"He wrote 'alone' like it's a note you're supposed to hit," he said.

"It's a trap," Eli said when they gathered, already dressed, already awake like he'd never really gone to sleep.

Zara's eyes were unfocused.
"And it's bait," she said. "North wing is running hot and too quiet where people should be angry."

Lyra held up her hands.
"He said my father's life depends on it."

"It might," Eli said. "Or it might be a lever. Either way, we treat it as real."

Milo looked at her.
"You are not going alone."

The old instinct rose: carry it alone, carry it clean, call that love.
She let it pass and missed the blunt certainty for one ugly second.

"Okay," she said. "Then we do it as a unit. We just don't give him one target."

Eli's mouth tightened. "Split tasking."
"Split tasking," Lyra agreed.

Eli pulled a maintenance key from his pocket.
"I lifted this off a ward tech during the breach. If Harlow is pulling you to Sub-level 7, he wants the rest of us blind." He met Milo's eyes. "So we do the opposite. We break lowest archives while he thinks he's isolating her."

Milo's jaw set.
"Three bad ideas and a stolen key. Classic us."

Zara touched Lyra's wrist.
"You go down. I map the emotional field between you and him. If his intent spikes, I call it."

Lyra nodded.
"And if I go dark?"

"Then we assume worst-case and move anyway," Eli said.

Milo added, softer: "And we still come."

They moved on the lock cycle: Eli counted clicks, Milo listened for patrol routes, Zara read which corners suggested eyes, and Lyra followed pressure lines the way she followed tension in a knot.

The descent behind East Tower lab sectors went deeper than public blueprints.
Stone gave way to thread-infused steel.
Air tasted like bleach and wet rust.

At the Sub-level 7 threshold, a containment lattice waited in the doorframe like a held breath.

Harlow stood just inside it with his bad hand wrapped and his eyes too awake.

"Thank you for coming," he said.

Lyra didn't step over the line. "Show me my father."

Harlow's gaze flicked past her, searching the corridor.

"Alone," he said.

Lyra held his stare. "Not anymore."

Behind her, somewhere in the building's lower spine, a quiet alarm began.
The kind that didn't ring, only logged.

Eli, Milo, and Zara had already moved.

Harlow's expression tightened.
"Then we are out of time," he said.

Lyra stepped through the lattice.
