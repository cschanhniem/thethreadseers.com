# Chapter 26: The Last Normal Moment

Wei met Lyra in the infirmary kitchenette at a table meant for staff on twelve-hour shifts.

Outside the door, emergency red still bled under the frame, and the lock-cycle clicks came too fast to ignore.

He looked worse in daylight, not dramatically worse, just small failures accumulating: a tremor he hid by wrapping both hands around a paper cup, a pause before he found the right word, the careful way he stood, weight shifting in small tests before he trusted his own feet.

Lyra watched all of it and kept her eyes on her own hands, flat on her thighs.

Wei set Lin's journal on the table between them. "I have to go back to Westbrook," he said. "They'll want scans."

"I can come," Lyra said.

Wei shook his head once. "Not today," he said. "Today you sleep, you eat, you let your nervous system stop thinking the world is an emergency."

"It is an emergency," Lyra said.

"Yes," Wei said. "But you still need fuel."

She wanted to argue. She knew how to argue with him, how to build the syllogism until he had to concede.

Instead she took out Nai Nai's pendant and set it beside the journal.

"I can't see threads the old way," she said.

Wei's eyes flicked to her face. "What can you do?"

Lyra hesitated, then placed her fingertips on the jade. A fine vibration met her touch, not an image but a pressure, a direction.

For one breath, the kitchenette smelled of damp sacking and old metal.

"I can feel where things pull," she said. "Like tension in a knot."

Wei stared at the pendant, then at Lin's diagrams on the open page.

"She tried to tell me," he said. "And I kept demanding she translate it into my language."

Lyra traced a knot sketch in the margin.
"I don't think it translates cleanly," she said.

Wei exhaled, almost a laugh. "Good. Maybe that's the point."

For a few minutes they ate cafeteria toast and watched sunlight crawl across the floor tiles. Wei rolled the paper cup between his palms until the tremor slowed.

Milo showed up with Zara and Eli, carrying a paper bag like contraband.

"I brought offerings," Milo said. "It's mostly sugar and poor decisions."

"That tracks," Eli said.

Zara gave Wei a small nod that carried more respect than most adults ever earned from her.
"How are you holding up?"

Wei lifted the cup. "Functional," he said. He looked at his hands around the cup. "Not fine."

Milo winced. "Oof. Direct-to-the-ribs."

Lyra elbowed him.

Eli set his slate on the table, already in motion.
"Protocols changed overnight," he said. "Lock cycles shortened. East Wing access tighter. Faculty calendars sanitized."
"You say everything like a memo," Milo said.
"Memos get doors open," Eli replied without looking up.

Lyra looked at him. "If it comes down to one person in the chair and everyone else breathing, what do you pick?"
Eli finally lifted his eyes. "Whoever still says yes after hearing what it costs."
"Sirens are part of the cost," Milo said.
"I know," Eli said.
Zara set her cup down harder than she meant to. "Which is why none of us touches that switch alone."

Zara's gaze drifted to the ceiling. Her shoulders rose, held, then lowered.
"No one's breathing normal," she said.

The same strain sat in Lyra's jaw like she'd been clenching all night.

Wei closed Lin's journal. "Listen," he said to Lyra. "I can't protect you by refusing reality anymore."

Lyra swallowed.
"And I can't protect you by sacrificing myself," she said.
"I almost said yes in Hall Seven," she added. "Not because I trusted him. Because he offered me one body instead of many and I wanted the math to make me innocent."

Wei's eyes softened.
"Remember you said that," he said. "They'll try to make it sound cleaner."

A corridor lock clicked somewhere nearby, another emergency cycle. Emergency red swept under the kitchenette door and moved on.

Wei stood, slow. "I'll call you after the scan," he said.

Lyra rose too.
"If you forget," she said, forcing steadiness, "I'll call you and pretend it's your idea."

Wei smiled. "Deal."

When he left, the room gained air for two breaths, then lost it again.

Milo tore open the paper bag.
"Okay," he said. "We have, what, one hour where we can pretend we're students?"

"Forty-three minutes," Eli corrected.

Zara nudged Lyra's shoulder. "Take the forty-three," she said.

They did. Milo bit into a pastry and made a face. "This is not food," he announced, already reaching for another one.

"And yet," Zara said, "you persist."

Eli glanced between his slate and the bag. "Every time you complain, you eat another one."

"Don't make it weird," Milo said, pointing a flaky corner at him.

Lyra laughed once, real, and for a few minutes the fluorescent hum sounded like a kitchen fan instead of a warning tone.

Then the building shuddered, subtle as a warning, and they all went quiet at the same time.
Milo tried to joke again, stopped midway through a sentence, and stared at the table like a word had dropped out of him.
