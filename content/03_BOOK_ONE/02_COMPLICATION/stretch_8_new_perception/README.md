# Stretch 8: New Perception & Escalating Threats (Complication Arc)

## Purpose
Lyra adapts to the new sensory reality while external pressure spikes: threats turn physical, and the crisis stops feeling abstract.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 26: The Last Normal Moment (`26.md`)**: Wei's understanding shifts; Lyra tests her new perception; the quartet holds.
- **Chapter 27: Breach Night (`27.md`)**: A Syndicate attack turns the campus into an emergency map.
- **Chapter 28: The Summons & The Descent (`28.md`)**: Harlow pulls Lyra downward into the machine's core logic.

## Notes
- Keep term load under control in summaries; let scenes carry the system.
