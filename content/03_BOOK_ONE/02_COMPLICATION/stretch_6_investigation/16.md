# Chapter 16: The Watcher

Lyra woke before curfew bells and stood at the dorm window with her palm against cold glass.

For three nights, the same sensation had followed her across campus: a thread pulled taut between her shoulder blades.
It felt less like panic than intake, like someone opening a clipboard before asking her name.

East Tower kept one light on, clinical white on the fourth floor.
A silhouette stood in it, still as a pin in cloth.

The pendant at her throat turned to ice.

Lyra opened the quartet chat, typed *I think he's watching me*, then deleted it.
Typed again, deleted again.

After midnight the Academy shifted into harsher protocol tiers; every bulletin said the same thing in cleaner language: the margin was collapsing.
Doors now auto-locked by zone every seven minutes, and hall monitors pinged for any student outside assigned sectors.
Even the air handlers had changed pitch, low and uneven, like the building was breathing through clenched teeth.

Her tablet chimed over all of it.
A banner filled the screen:

> Wei Chen  
> Westbrook Neurological Institute - Room 247  
> Neural pathway degradation accelerating  
> Immediate family consultation recommended

The message sat there while her mind tried to split itself in two directions.
Go now, or stay and stop what was happening here.

She called the nurse line.
Wei was resting after an episode. Confusion worse. Motor tremor intermittent.
They could wake him for a call if she insisted.

Lyra stared at the dark window reflection of her own face and did the math she hated.
If she left tonight and Harlow moved before dawn, she could lose the trail for good.
If she stayed, she would miss another night her father might still know her name.

"Don't wake him," she said quietly. "Tell him I called. Tell him I'll be there in the morning."

She sent the message she had deleted.

*Lyra: East Tower light is on again. Same watcher.*

Replies came fast.

*Milo: Either ghost professor or insomnia contest. I vote both.*

*Eli: Jokes later. Meet library service alcove in ten. Bring notes.*

*Zara: You're not walking alone tonight. Wait where you are. I'm coming up.*

By the time Zara arrived, the East Tower light was out.
That was worse.

Three floors above, Marcus Harlow reviewed surveillance feeds with his bad hand wrapped in compression tape.

Lyra's movement routes, friend-group clustering, pendant responses under stress.
Each log carried a clean timestamp and an emergency code. He still kept his eyes off the still frames where she looked straight into camera.

He set down a cup of tea gone cold and opened the lacquered box he kept locked behind the terminal rack.

A photograph, a silver hairpin, dried cherry petals.

Aiko smiling under Kyoto blossoms.
Mei leaning into frame, annoyed at being photographed and still laughing.

Kyoto had not killed them.
It had removed him.

When he finally found them again, Kyoto finished its work on paper.
A restraining order, delivered before sundown.

He had memorized every line of that document.
He still read it on bad nights.

A fresh routing alert opened on-screen:

> Chen group moving toward restricted archive access vectors.

He could lock the stairwells and end it.
He could pull guards and stage a clean intercept.

Instead he adjusted corridor permissions by half-steps.
One route opened, two routes narrowed, dorm patrols shifted three minutes late.

In his notes it sat under triage. In his mouth it tasted like bait.

At the service alcove, the four of them stood over Eli's map overlay while door locks clacked open and shut on the seven-minute cycle.

"We have one workable entry window before sector lockdown," Eli said. "Miss it and we wait another hour we don't have."

"My dad's crashing," Lyra said. "Hospital wants me there."

Advice hovered and died in all three throats.

Milo scratched at the edge of a burned bandage and looked at her, not at the map.
"If we hit the archive now, we might buy him options later. If you go to the hospital now, you'll be there counting heartbeats and hating yourself for not being here. Either way hurts."

Zara's voice stayed level.
"Whatever you pick, we don't split."

Eli nodded once.
"We need records before Harlow scrubs them," Eli said. "And we need you in one piece for whatever comes after."

Lyra looked from one of them to the next. The fear did not ease; it just found an order she could move inside.

"Archive first," she said. "Hospital at first transport after dawn. No detours."

Milo exhaled.
"Okay. Bad plan. Only plan."

Above them, emergency tones rolled through the dorm towers, died, then returned.

In East Tower darkness, Harlow watched the same narrowing window from the opposite side.
He left one stairwell unlocked and delayed two patrol pings by ninety seconds.
By dawn, they would call it luck.
He would call it cost and bill it to whoever was youngest in the room.
