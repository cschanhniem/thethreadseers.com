# Stretch 6: Investigation (Complication Arc)

## Purpose
Shift from suspicion to proof: the quartet pulls records, the Academy tightens its grip, and Harlow escalates from surveillance to engineered outcomes.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 16: The Watcher (`16.md`)**: Lyra feels measured; Harlow's logic is revealed in parallel.
- **Chapter 17: Kyoto Files (`17.md`)**: The quartet infiltrates restricted archives and pulls what the Academy tried to bury; the Thread-Maze triggers and containment begins.
- **Chapter 18: The Alliance (`18.md`)**: Lines of cooperation and complicity sharpen; Harlow's embedded section ("THE FATHER'S DILEMMA") shows habit, not absolution.
- **Chapter 19: Rising Instability (`19.md`)**: The quartet commits to stopping the Conduit, even without a clean plan.
- **Chapter 20: The Trap Springs (`20.md`)**: Lyra's gambit backfires; Milo pays the price; the Conduit changes state.

## Notes
- Chapter 17B and Chapter 20 now have distinct titles; avoid reintroducing duplicate naming in notes.
