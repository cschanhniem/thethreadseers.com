# Chapter 19: Rising Instability

Just before dawn, Lyra slipped into the dorm common room.

In the hallway behind her, hard red warning light washed the floor and kept everyone moving.

Milo, Zara, and Eli were already there, arranged around cold tea like they'd been waiting long enough for the waiting to harden.

Milo stood first.
"You disappeared during lockdown and came back with blood on your knuckles. Start at the part where we panic."

Lyra closed the door, checked the corridor, and played the recording from Chief Blackwood's office.

Harlow's voice came through first, clipped and tired: *viable profile*.
Milo's fingers stopped drumming at that line and did not start again.

When the clip ended, Eli exhaled and switched into operations voice.
"Thread Maze practical in three days was never the real event. Hall Seven is."

"Acquisition," Milo said. "Kidnapping with a syllabus."

"Yes," Eli said.

Zara had her eyes half-closed, reading the room and the building through spill.
"Staff signatures are wrong all over east sector," she said. "Not panic yet. It's that look people get right before they do what they're told."

Lyra touched the pendant at her throat.
"He thinks my resonance can anchor the Conduit."

Milo looked at her.
"Anchor like stabilize?"

"Anchor like chain," Lyra said.

The first tremor hit hard enough to rattle the hanging lamps.
The second came deeper, with that off-beat pulse the Academy had developed in the last twelve hours.

Eli checked his scanner.
"Sharp jump," he said. "It's climbing again."

Somewhere below, glass broke.
Emergency tones started in one wing, then another, never fully syncing.

Milo pressed two fingers to his temple.
"Campus harmonics are running sharp. Like everything's tuned half a note too high and ready to tear."

Lyra moved the map slate to the center of the table.
"We don't win a basement war tonight," she said. "We collect proof, keep each other alive, and make burying it expensive."

"Evidence first," Eli said, already tagging routes. "Sabotage only if we get forced."
"Or we let them think we're isolated and make them show the full route."

"No," Milo said, immediate.

Eli didn't look up. "I said lure, not surrender."
Lyra held his gaze until he did look up.
"We are not rehearsing my kidnapping as strategy."
Eli nodded once. "Fair."

"And if we get forced?" Milo asked.

"Then we get ugly efficiently," Eli said.

Zara nodded toward the east corridor.
"Crowd panic wave in six minutes. We move before it peaks."

Another tremor rolled through the floor.

Lyra looked at each of them in turn.
"Nobody vanishes for thirty seconds without the rest of us tearing the floor apart."

Milo grabbed his resonator case.
"And nobody says they're fine when they're not."

Zara took the door.
"If we freeze, someone else chooses for us."

Eli killed the lights and opened the map overlay.
"Then we move now, before the crowd chooses a villain and helps him."

They stepped into the corridor as the Academy shuddered again. Two doors down, something slid under a threshold with a soft, deliberate rasp.
