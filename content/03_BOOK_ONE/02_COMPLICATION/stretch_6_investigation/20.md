# Chapter 20: The Trap Springs

Before sunrise, a notice slid under every first-year door.

Outside Lyra's room, corridor lights strobed red, and everyone moved like there was barely more than a day left.

It read:

> **[EMERGENCY ASSEMBLY NOTICE | Hall Seven]**
>
> Thus entered into record:
> Emergency Assembly | Hall Seven | 08:00 | Mandatory.
> Reason: Southern Nexus strain; live demonstration required.
> Selected students may be requested to assist stabilization.
> Consent will be requested prior to stabilization contact.
> (In smaller type: Under emergency declaration, staff directives supersede individual preference.)
> Follow staff instructions until clearance is given.
> (The red border bled where the paper had gotten damp.)
> (No signature; no sunset listed.)

Milo read it once and snorted.
"Mandatory plus red border means theater with security backing."

"Hall Seven has independent lockdown," Eli said. "If this is a trap, it's a good one."

Zara stood at the window, listening to the field.
"Faculty signatures are flattened this morning. Everyone's braced."

Lyra folded the notice and put it in her pocket. Her father had maybe a day at this decline rate. If Harlow was lying, this was a cage. If he was telling part of the truth, walking away might be the last useful choice she ever got.

"We need witnesses," Eli said.

"We need choices that are real," Zara added, voice low. "Not panic wearing bravery."

They went down one floor to the first-year common room.

Twenty students clustered under the harsh overhead lights with the same damp-bordered notice in their hands.
Some were crying quietly. Some were laughing too sharp. One boy was already saying, loud, "If they try to pull on us, we pull back harder."
The fear in the room didn't sit in bodies; it moved between them, contagious as cough.

Lyra felt the pull in her own chest: *say something that makes them follow you.*
That urge tasted almost like relief.

She didn't let it become a command.

"Thread-silence," she said, not loudly, not as a threat. "One minute. Don't look through each other. Just breathe."

A few students blinked like she'd asked them to stop having skin.

Milo stepped forward and tapped a slow, low pattern against the doorframe, nothing pretty, just a frequency that made the room's edge find itself again.
The chatter softened by degrees.

Eli held up the notice.
"Facts," he said. "No speeches."
He pointed with one finger, clinical.
"No signature. No sunset. Emergency declaration overrides preference in smaller type. That's not consent. That's a trap with clean ink."

A girl near the couch shook her head. "So what do we do?"

Zara answered without smoothing it.
"First, you get to leave," she said.
"If you're here because you're scared and copying someone else's certainty, go. That's not a test. That's you keeping your yes clean."

Milo kept the low beat.
One by one, students stood, eyes down, and walked out into the hall.
No one stopped them.
No one called them coward.
The room got smaller.
The air got clearer.

Lyra watched the ones who stayed.
Hands still shaking. Faces still young. Fear still present, but no longer borrowed.

"If you stay," Lyra said, "this is what staying costs."
She held the notice up with her thumb covering the neatest lines.
"Hall Seven locks. Staff will ask for volunteers and call it stabilization. Some of you will want to say yes because the room wants a yes. That isn't consent. That is contagion."

She made herself stop there.
Not persuasion. Not panic. Just terms.

Eli slid his slate onto the coffee table and opened a recorder app.
"We can do one useful thing that doesn't require heroics," he said. "Keep the log. Names. Times. Exact words. If anything goes wrong, you export it. Chain-of-custody matters."

"And if someone asks for thread-silence," Milo added, "you honor it. Even if the room wants you curious."

A student swallowed. "What if they *order* us?"

Lyra didn't lie.
"Then your job is still to keep your hands open," she said. "And to keep a record of who ordered what."

No one cheered.
No one pledged anything clean.
They nodded, small, like people agreeing to a weather report.

Lyra gave them one final out.
"Last chance," she said. "If you're not sure, leave now."

Two more students stood and went.

The ones left in the room pulled their tablets out and wrote their own names at the top of blank notes pages, not as signatures of obedience but as ownership of the record.

When Lyra turned back toward the door, her pulse still shook.
But it was hers.

"We go together," she said.

Hall Seven looked less like a classroom than a cleared operating room.
No training rigs, no student stations, one central platform ringed by monitors and containment pylons.

Harlow stood at the primary console.
Chief Blackwood stood at the exits with visible security for the first time.

"Recent structural strain in the Southern Nexus requires live demonstration," Harlow said.

Eli leaned close enough for only the four of them to hear.
"Southern Nexus is stable. Public and internal reports. He invented the pretext."

Harlow's gaze found Lyra.
"Ms. Chen. Your profile is uniquely suited to this procedure."

Containment fields thudded into Lyra's ribs before she moved.
Doors sealed behind them with a final magnetic thud.

She stepped onto the platform anyway.
Better one target than four.

A compact Conduit variant rolled from behind the console: obsidian core, black-silver intake filaments, restraint arcs disguised as polished frame.

Harlow addressed the room like he was still teaching.
"I can keep the south foundation from tearing, but only with a compatible anchor. Wait an hour and you'll be counting bodies."

He threw up projections: fracture maps, casualty models, a Kyoto branch that ended in black.

Lyra's mouth shaped yes before she could stop it.
The taste of it went thin and metallic; her stomach turned.
She knew that taste now: relief first, then invoice.

Then the intake lock cinched under her sternum, mechanical and intimate.

"You didn't ask," she said.

Harlow held her eyes.
"We're past debate. People die in the next hour."

"Don't say my name like it's a number you can move," Lyra said.

Chief Blackwood signaled.
Barrier glass rose between platform and students.

Milo hit it with his palm.
"Lyra!"

The first extraction pulse hit and her teeth clacked hard enough to sting.
Something dragged through her sternum and she gagged on her own breath.
Lyra folded, then forced herself upright.

One idea cut through the pain.
If she burned her own link fast enough, she could break the leverage over her father.

She reversed the flow.

The system screamed as containment stuttered and the current snapped sideways.

Milo cried out and dropped.
His harmonic signature cut out so fast Lyra's ears popped.

"No," she said, already moving through the failing field. "Stay with me."

The Conduit core split into spiderweb cracks.
Under the black intake lattice, another pattern surfaced: pale, conductive, responsive.

Lyra reached Milo and found the torn edge in his signal.
Jagged. Reachable.

She laid her current against the torn pattern and fed it in slow pulses, matching the cadence Milo had drilled into them until it lived under their skin.

One, two, three, four.

The count did not arrive as sound. It arrived as pressure behind her teeth, a borrowed insistence in her wrists. Her field had no right to know it, and knowing made her stomach turn.

For a moment, the boundary blurred. Panic rode his resonance and tried to ride her with it. Underneath, a bright stubborn note held on, not pretty, just alive.

His fingers snagged her wrist.

"Too close," he rasped. "Lyra, that's too close."

"I know," she said, and hated the part of her that wanted to hold tighter. "Don't drop."

Milo gasped, then flinched at a returning overtone.

"It's there," he said hoarsely. "Different. Still there."

Around them, Hall Seven lost sequence: one student retched into a sleeve, two guards shouted opposite commands into the same channel, and the west barrier tried to close on empty air.

Harlow stared at the rewritten machine like it had rejected him in public.

Lyra barely made it to one knee before secondary containment dropped over the platform.

Harlow stepped inside the field.
"Private phase now. This room is compromised."

"You're not taking her," Milo snapped, trying to stand.
He made it two steps before his legs failed.

Eli and Zara caught him and dragged him clear of the collapsing barrier line.

Lyra kicked at the field seam.
Charge threw her back.

Sedation came hot and fast at the base of her neck.

The last thing she saw before the room narrowed was her friends behind fractured glass: Milo still fighting through pain, Zara already scanning pursuit routes, Eli mapping lockdown paths in real time.

They were not retreating.
Eli's fingers kept moving.
Zara didn't look away.
Milo's palm stayed on the glass.
Milo's palm stayed on the glass.
Then the world skipped, not blurring but cutting.
