# Chapter 17: Kyoto Files

The restricted archive sat three levels below main stacks, down a spiral stair that smelled of wet stone, dust, and old copper.

On the landing, amber had shifted to warning red, and nobody called the danger theoretical anymore.

Lyra led while Eli carried bypass tools and a portable hash pad.
Milo kept one hand on the wall, listening for structural shifts, and Zara watched all three of them for stress before it spiked.

The dampening wards were thick enough to turn Lyra's thread-sight into static and flashes.
Whatever the Academy kept down here, it did not want anyone reading in real time.

Milo found the drawer first.
`Dimensional Incidents - Classified`
One folder had been handled recently.
Stamped date:
Kyoto, 1997.

They spread the contents on a steel table.
Photo strips, readout shards, witness statements, casualty forms.

In the pre-incident team photo, a younger Marcus Harlow stood beside a woman and child.
Aiko Harlow.
Mei Harlow.

"His family," Lyra said.

Eli read from the summary sheet.
"Experimental extraction cascade. Two dead confirmed. Three listed missing."

"Missing," Zara repeated.

Milo turned over a handwritten addendum.
"There's a side note on memory discontinuity in survivors outside blast radius."

The conclusion arrived as a body-memory, not a thought.
Severance, not simple loss.
People alive, links cut.

Lyra hated that her first reaction was not horror but recognition.
Horror caught up a breath later and stayed.

Beneath the Kyoto file sat folded schematics marked `Magnus Conduit`.
Eli flattened them carefully.

"This wasn't a panic rig built overnight," he said. "This is planned in phases."

The central chamber drawing showed one human anchor point, invasive stabilization lines, and automated restraint geometry.
In Harlow's own margin notes:

> **[HARLOW | MARGIN NOTES | Kyoto File]**
>
> *Animus Argenti compatibility required.*
> *Subject survival estimate: 73%.*
> (The 73 is circled twice; the pen digs through the paper.)

Milo read that twice, jaw set.

A second bundle mapped extraction taps across housing blocks, training rooms, and emergency lines.

"This is campus scale," Eli said. "If he finishes rollout, opting out becomes theater."

Zara opened a thin packet labeled Lin Chen.
The first pages were method objections. Then ethics warnings. Then fear.

> **[LIN CHEN | PACKET (EXCERPT) | Kyoto Files]**
>
> *Marcus calls coercion prevention and sleeps on it.*
> *He thinks enough power can bully restoration into happening.*
> *If he weaponizes foundation-thread pathways, students will be at risk.*
> *I signed one emergency override under protest. Subject survived. Memory did not.*
> *I do not know what to call that except harm with clean paperwork.*
> *Clean words don’t clean wounds.*
> (One sentence is crossed out so hard the fibers show; the page was restapled out of order.)
>
> Final full entry (dated days before Lin vanished from Academy records):
> *If governance will not stop this, I will hide what I can and prepare safeguards for the next generation.*

Lyra held the page and kept her breathing even.

"She didn't leave because she stopped loving us," she said. "She ran out of soft options while students bled."

Eli tapped the override line with one finger.
"She acted too. Once."

Lyra nodded.
"And hated the price enough to write it down."

At the back of the folder, Eli found one final photograph: post-incident rubble through smoke, blurred at distance.
At frame edge stood a woman with silver-lit thread channels around her hands.

Lyra did not need the face.

"She was there," Lyra said. "At Kyoto."

"Copies, not originals," Eli said, already opening the scanner. "If this goes to Council, chain-of-custody has to survive contact."

They moved fast: scan, hash, encrypt.
Milo kept time while Zara kept watch at the doorway, eyes on a corridor that felt too quiet.

None of them saw the thin black-silver filament waking inside the wall seam behind the shelf column.

By the time Lyra sealed Lin's notes in her satchel, the silent alarm had already reached Sub-level 7.

* * *

In the Restricted Archives, Lyra sealed the satchel. The warning tone over the exit sharpened another step.
"We go straight to Weaver. No detours."

The lights died.

Seconds later, emergency red strips came on, painting the stacks in narrow bars of color.
Then the floor shifted.

"That isn't a quake," Eli said. "That's internal routing."

Black-silver lines began crawling down the archive walls, crossing each other like circuitry waking up.

Milo stepped back from the nearest shelf.
"Those aren't passive wards."

Zara's shoulders tightened.
"Predatory intent, layered, and not from one source. It's in the walls now."

The aisle behind them sealed with a translucent barrier.
Another opened to the left where there had been stone three seconds earlier.

"Not a student maze," Eli said. "It's using the building and learning off us in real time."

Lyra forced her voice steady.
"Then we move before it finishes naming us."

They ran.

The first corridor looped them back to the same archive door.
The second split into three routes and changed while they watched.
In the third, the air pressure dropped so fast Milo staggered and grabbed a shelf for balance.

Above them, the Academy alarm chain started in staggered waves.
Not evacuation, the low two-tone for containment, the one that told families to wait behind glass.

"He knows what we found," Zara said.

"He wants us moving scared," Lyra answered. "Don't hand him clean panic."

They slowed just enough to stop feeding panic into the room.
Breathing count, step count, callouts on every turn.

Eli pulled up a schematic overlay on his wrist screen and swore.
"No static map anymore. He's generating routes off our responses."

"Then we respond wrong on purpose," Milo said.

He struck a short, dissonant rhythm against the wall panel.
The nearest black-silver line flickered.

"Good," Eli said. "Do that again."

They moved by interference instead of speed, forcing micro-errors into the maze's prediction cycle.
The path to the service stairs opened for four seconds.

Lyra shoved Zara through first, then Milo, then Eli.
She jumped the closing seam and hit the landing hard.

Below, the stairs dropped toward sub-level sectors already under lockdown.
Above, alarms rolled through the dorm towers.

Wherever Harlow was, he had stopped pretending this was instruction.

Lyra tightened her grip on Lin's journal.

"He drew the lines," she said. "Good. Then we move like a hand he never learned to read."
