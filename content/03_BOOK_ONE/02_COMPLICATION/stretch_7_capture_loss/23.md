# Chapter 23: The Healing and the Harm

The infirmary lights stayed dim for trauma ward hours. Outside the door, emergency red swept the corridor every six seconds with the lock cycle.
Every few minutes, the lock banks reset, and the building answered with a low, tired shudder.

Lyra sat upright on a narrow cot with a blanket around her shoulders, listening through her new sense-map: footsteps as pressure, voices as temperature shifts, emotion as weight in the air.

Milo sat backward in a chair, arms folded over the backrest. Zara stood by the sink with two paper cups. Eli held discharge notes in front of him, thumb pinning the corner; his eyes kept returning to the same line.

"How's the ringing?" Lyra asked.

Milo tilted his head, testing a frequency only he could hear.

"Annoying," he said. "So: still me. Just louder in the wrong places."
He tapped two fingers on the chair back. "One upper register is gone. It used to sit right behind people's voices. Now there's a hole."

Zara snorted once and handed Lyra a cup.

"Doctor says his resonance came back cleaner than expected," she said. "Doctor also says that missing register is not coming back. And no heroics."

"That sounds anti-art," Milo said.

Eli finally lowered the chart. "It sounds medically indicated," he said. Then, softer: "We almost lost both of you. I'm not rounding that down."

Silence settled, and Lyra turned the paper cup in her hands until the rim softened under her thumb.

"I did it," she said. "In Hall Seven. I thought I could cut myself free and save my father. I hit Milo instead."

"You also pulled me back," Milo said.

His fingers tightened on the chair back.

"And it was... too close," he added. "Like you were inside my chord."

Lyra flinched. "I didn't have time to ask."

"No," Milo said. "You didn't."
"And I still wake up with your pulse in my teeth."

"That doesn't erase the first part."

"No," Eli said. "It doesn't."

He crossed the room and sat on the edge of the next cot, close enough to be heard without raising his voice.

"Name it straight," he said. "Harlow built the trap and forced the sequence. You broke it under pressure. You also crossed into Milo without asking. Both happened."

Milo's jaw worked once.

"Next time," he said, voice rough, "one word first. If you can't give me that, don't touch my field."

Lyra nodded. "I will."

Zara leaned against Lyra's shoulder.

"You're allowed to be wrecked," she said. "You're not allowed to exile yourself from us."

Lyra exhaled, long and uneven.

"I don't know how to do this version of me yet."

"None of us do," Milo said. "Great. We can be confused as a team." He tapped his chest. "Also for the record, whatever you stitched back in here? I hear overtones I never heard before. It's weird. I hate weird. But I also kind of love weird."
"I can't hear my own top string," he added after a beat. "But I can hear panic three rooms away. Trade felt bad at first. Still does. Still useful."

Zara shot him a look.
"Don't perform being okay," she said. "Just be here."

That got a short laugh out of Lyra before she could stop it.

Eli looked relieved enough that he didn't hide it.

Outside the infirmary, the Academy still groaned under aftershock strain. Inside, four first-years sat with bandages, bad coffee, and a problem big enough to kill them.

They stayed anyway.

Lyra put her hand in the center between them.
This time she did not touch anyone first; she left her palm on the blanket where they could choose it.
"If I start reaching because I'm scared," she said, "grab my wrist and make me ask."

Milo stacked his hand over hers.
"If I joke when I should warn," he said, "cut me off."

Zara added hers.
"If I answer for somebody because I can feel the answer," she said, "call me on it."

Eli added the last.
"If I hide harm in cleaner phrasing," he said, "don't let me finish the sentence."

Lyra nodded once.
"Ask first. Never seize." Lyra said.
"And when we don't..."
She looked at Milo first, because she owed him the cleanest version of the truth.
"Stop," she said. "Name it. Ask what got taken. Offer repair in their terms. If the answer is not yet, we take not yet."
She let the next line land without softening it.
"Stay. Repair in the open. No clean language."

"Not a vow," she added, voice quieter. "Just instructions for when we get ugly again."

They kept their hands stacked for one quiet beat too long, until footsteps passed the door and the corridor locks clicked through another emergency cycle.
When they let go, Milo flexed his fingers like checking whether they still belonged to him.
