# Chapter 25: Infirmary Reconciliation

Wei arrived after visiting hours with Lin's journal under his arm. Outside the infirmary, emergency red had eased to warning amber, but every lock-cycle click still sounded like a clock pretending to help.

He stood at the foot of Lyra's bed for a long time before he spoke.

"I read her notes," he said. "All of them. I didn't skim. I didn't argue in the margins. I read."

Lyra waited.

Wei opened the journal to a page of knot diagrams and silver annotations in Lin's hand.

"I spent years calling this metaphor because I couldn't measure it," he said. "That wasn't skepticism. It was fear in a lab coat."

His voice shook on the last word and steadied again.

"I told myself I was protecting you from fantasy. What I was really protecting was my own certainty."

Lyra looked at the page, then at him.

"You don't have to do this because of what happened," she said.

"I'm doing it because of what I did *before* what happened."

He sat.

"Harlow offered a switch he could flip and call safety," Wei said. "I understand why that seduces people."
He stared at his own hand on the blanket.
"In the ambulance, for one minute, I wanted him to pull it if it meant you stayed breathing."
He did not look away from the admission.
"That minute still belongs to me."
Lyra's throat tightened.
"Mine too," she said. "For one second in that room, I wanted him to force it and call it mercy."

He tapped Lin's notes.

"Your mother wrote, ask first. Then in the margin: stay humble. Don't turn people into inputs. I dismissed that, and he used the gap."

Lyra swallowed.

"I can't see threads the old way anymore," she said. "I don't know what I am right now."

Wei reached out, then paused until she nodded.

When she did, he took her hand.

"You're my daughter," he said. "I don't need a monitor for that."

She laughed once through tears.

Wei turned a few pages and found a sketch of a little girl reaching toward a silver line.

Under it, Lin had written:

*She'll need understanding, not protection.*

Wei closed the journal halfway.

"I failed that line for a long time," he said. "I'm not failing it now."

Lyra leaned her head against his shoulder.

"Then stay," she whispered.

"I'm staying," he said.

He read Lin's notes aloud until midnight, stumbling once on an old shorthand mark and waiting while Lyra corrected him.
Then he kept reading, translating equations and ritual language into something they could both hold.

By the time he left, Lyra's fear hadn't vanished.
It had changed shape: less cliff edge, more weight.
When the door closed, she caught herself listening for Wei's returning footsteps and hated how quickly hope and panic had learned to share a pulse.
