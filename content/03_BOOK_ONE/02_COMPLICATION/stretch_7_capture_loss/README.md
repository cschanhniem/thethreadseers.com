# Stretch 7: Capture & Loss (Complication Arc)

## Purpose
Force the quartet into consequences: Lyra is taken, the rescue fails, and the book shifts from "investigate" to "survive and choose under coercion."

## Chapters
- **Chapter 21: The Silver Soul (`21.md`)**: Lyra wakes restrained at the Conduit; the machine pulls at her; Harlow makes his case.
- **Chapter 22: The Sacrifice (`22.md`)**: The rescue attempt fails; the quartet regroups under narrowing time.
- **Chapter 23: The Healing and the Harm (`23.md`)**: Infirmary aftermath; new perception; the quartet commits to a no-solos pact.
- **Chapter 24: Silver Echoes (`24.md`)**: Lyra learns the new sense-map and finds leverage in tradition and practice; Harlow's embedded section ("THE MOMENT OF CHOICE") shifts the lane of harm.
- **Chapter 25: Infirmary Reconciliation (`25.md`)**: Lyra and Wei align; Lin's notes become usable, not symbolic.

## Notes
- Keep the stabilization beats legible in-scene; do not rely on the counter header alone.
