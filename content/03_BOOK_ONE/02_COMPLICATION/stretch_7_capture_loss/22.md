# Chapter 22: The Sacrifice

The first rescue push failed in under two minutes, fast enough that nobody could pretend they had almost made it.

Hall Seven stayed washed in emergency red while heat shimmer crawled under the door seams like breath.

Milo, Zara, and Eli hit the corridor at speed, drove through one defense line, and were thrown back by a containment blast that turned air into heat and shrapnel.

Lights died.
Wards ruptured.
Every loose cable snapped and dropped sparks that smelled like penny metal and burned plastic.

When the ringing cleared, Hall Seven was sealed and Lyra was gone from their scopes.

Syndicate pressure was closing from the south stairwell.
Security pressure was closing from the north.
Whoever reached the door first, the corridor still planned to kill them.

Milo tried to stand and folded to one knee, one hand clamped over his ear.
The ringing swallowed half the corridor. The other half was impact-thrum and distant alarms, all of it stacked into one brutal chord.
He couldn't tell whether his own voice was loud or only desperate.

"We go again," he said anyway.

Eli pinned his bleeding forearm against his chest and forced his voice steady. "Not blind and not through a kill corridor."

Zara listened to the field under the alarms.
"They're collapsing side channels to funnel us," she said. "If we hold this position, we die here."

Milo hit the wall hard enough to bruise his knuckles.
"She's in there."
His mouth kept shaping the words. The sealed door did not move.

Zara's voice went quieter. "I can still feel her. Faint. Moving."
She closed her eyes as if that would make it cleaner.
"She's braced," she said. "She's..."
She swallowed. "She wants us to..."

Milo's head snapped toward her. "Don't answer for her."
He exhaled hard, voice still rough. "Tell me what you feel. Not what you need it to mean."
Zara opened her eyes. "I feel her moving," she said. "I feel her holding. That's all."

That was the worst part.
Lyra was alive, and they still could not reach her.

The floor tremored beneath them. A wall panel spat sparks and flashed Weave-Quake structural warnings.
The Academy itself was taking damage.

Eli forced his breathing down into planning cadence.

"Medical wing," he said. "Li. Wei if he can stand. Then we push again with real access."

"Sounds like we leave her in there," Milo said, and the sentence came out as accusation before he could sand it down.

"Sounds like we come back alive," Eli said.

Zara hauled Milo up by his sleeve.
"We are not leaving her," she said. "We are changing approach."

Milo, Zara, and Eli withdrew under fire, using Milo's harmonic mapping to avoid active lines, and reached the infirmary corridor cut, burned, and still moving.
Milo's mapping came with a cost now. Every high note was a needle in his skull.

Nurse Hendricks triaged them in sequence: Eli's arm, Milo's resonance burns, Zara's overload tremor.

Chief Blackwood arrived in full kit, expression unreadable.

"Status," she said.

"Containment relocated," Eli answered. "Hall Seven's empty. Somebody moved her fast."

Chief Blackwood's wrist charm pulsed once. She stepped into the hall and took a call with her back to them.
Even through infirmary noise, Eli caught fragments: "...Sub-level access..." "...Sanctuary protocols active..." "...timeline accelerates..." "...protect the collection..."

When she came back, a decision had already been made.

"Emergency Council is in session," she said. "Professor Li is inbound."

"Inbound with what?" Milo asked.

Chief Blackwood held his gaze.
"With options you do not currently have."

She left before they could push harder.

On the way back to staging, Eli stopped at a cracked support wall where foundation threads showed through broken plaster.

"Look," he said. "It's rerouting."

Milo listened with his eyes closed.
"Distortion's still high," he said, "but it's no longer random. Building is finding a new key."

Zara put her palm against the wall and scanned the emotional field in the structure itself.
"It's holding," she said. "Not breaking yet."

It was the first useful signal they'd had all morning.
Dust slid from the cracked wall onto Zara's sleeve and she didn't brush it off.
If the Academy could adapt under load, so could they.

Wei met them outside the lower stairwell with Weaver and two security teams.
He looked pale, but his eyes were clear, as they hadn't been since Westbrook.

Eli didn't waste time on greetings.
"She's on Sub-level 3," he said. "Harlow moved her into the Conduit lab."

Wei's jaw tightened once. "Then we go."

As they descended, Eli patched into the building's internal audio channel: mostly static and alarms, until one clean line cut through.

Lyra's voice frayed. "Ask first. Please."

Harlow, too calm: "Asking doesn't hold a floor up."

Wei went faster.

Impact alarms detonated in the corridor ahead.
A blast.
A second, closer.

When they reached the lab door, the air had a new pitch, neither hunger nor scream.
A held chord sat in the metal, waiting to be named.

Milo stumbled, hand over his ear, and still forced himself upright.

Eli got the lock.
Zara held the field steady.
Wei went in first.

They found Lyra strapped to steel, chin down, hair stuck to her mouth with sweat. The Conduit pulled at her sternum in short, ugly pulses. Harlow stood at the controls with his jaw locked hard enough to jump.

Milo dropped beside the platform and set a metronome count against the rail. Not music. Just something steady to hold.

Zara put both hands on stone and took the room into her body until she could tell which fear was hers.
Eli got the alarms out of their ears and into his slate.

Lyra's silver channel touched the core.
The machine changed under their hands.

The restraints released with a latch giving up.

Wei caught Lyra as she folded. She stayed conscious long enough to clamp Milo's wrist once, hard, a word she couldn't speak through.

They got her out of Sub-level 3 with the building shuddering around them.
By the time the infirmary doors sealed, all of them were bleeding somewhere.

Milo sat on a supply crate with dried blood on his sleeve and stared at his hands like he didn't trust them.

"We failed the first push," he said. "Then we came back anyway."
His words were steady. His breathing wasn't.

Eli just nodded once. Zara sat beside Milo without touching him.
When a medic asked Milo for the date, he answered with his old metronome count before he caught himself and gave the day.
When Zara said his name, he turned only after Eli touched his shoulder.
