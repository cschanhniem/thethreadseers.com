# Stretch 5: Thread Failures (Complication Arc)

## Purpose
Start the Complication arc: more students are harmed, investigations converge, and the instability becomes operational, not theoretical.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 15: The Breakthrough Convergence (`15.md`)**: Aftermath spreads; factions converge; an embedded Harlow perspective shows what he does when rules get in his way.

## Notes
- Keep instability language consistent with the manuscript (diegetic, scene-grounded, not a UI overlay).
