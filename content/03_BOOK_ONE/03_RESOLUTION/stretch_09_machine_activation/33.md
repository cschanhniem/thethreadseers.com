# Chapter 33: The Father's Light & The Weave's Response

After the surge, the room looked cleaner and everyone in it looked worse.

Above the ruined control bank, emergency lights kept flipping red to white, unable to settle on what survival meant.

When the chamber stopped shaking, the quiet hit so hard Lyra heard her own pulse in her teeth.

Wei Chen was gone from physical space.
There was no body to lift and no final breath to witness, only the administrative cruelty of empty hands.

Lyra knelt on the cracked floor and kept both palms against the stone.
Under the stone, she could still feel him.
Not as speech, but as structure: a steady warmth threaded through foundation lines and fault seams.

Milo stayed on her left, still wincing at sudden sounds.
Zara stayed on her right, eyes closed, mapping emotional shock through the room.
Eli stood over a handheld scanner and read numbers twice before trusting them.

"Major rifts are closing," he said quietly. "The drop is real this time."

Only scanner ticks answered him, thin and dry, like coins dropped one at a time into a locked box.

Then another presence brushed the edge of Lyra's link.
Lighter than her father's.
Older than this night.

A memory moved through her before words did:
her mother tying her hair at a kitchen table,
a melody she had not remembered in years,
the scent of tea leaves warming in a clay cup.

Little star.

Just two words, clear as a bell struck once.

Lyra inhaled hard.
"Mama?"

The contact did not hold shape.
It came as pressure, tenderness, and orientation; no instructions, no prophecy, no bargain.
For one second Lyra forgot where her own skin ended and the chamber stone began.
Nai Nai's line returned, unasked and unsoftened: *You cannot touch without being touched.*

One feeling remained after it thinned:

an open door and cold metal where a lock should have been.

Lyra wiped her face with the back of her wrist and stood.
Milo said her name once.
"Lin -" Lyra answered, then flinched and corrected herself. "Lyra. Sorry."

* * *

Eli turned his scanner so the others could see.
The strain pattern was still dangerous, but falling in a real line now.

"We're still bad," he said. "But it's moving the right direction. If nobody upstairs improvises heroics, it holds."

Milo let out a shaky breath. "Time for what? To do this again with cleaner language?"

"He bought us time," Zara said. "And we don't get to spend it on silence."

Lyra looked at the transformed Conduit, then at Harlow, then at the sealed breach doors where Council teams would arrive within minutes.

"Then we take it upstairs now, before anyone rewrites tonight into procedure," she said. "Raw logs. Full names."

Above them, the Academy lights steadied one row at a time.
A single strip over East Wing stuttered and held on emergency red.
