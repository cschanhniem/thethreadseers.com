# Stretch 9: Machine Activation & Sacrifice (Resolution Arc)

## Purpose
Deliver the climax: the Conduit's true cost is exposed, the quartet stops being reactive, and Wei makes the only choice that fits his ethics.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 29: The Price of Life (`29.md`)**: Harlow forces an ultimatum; Lyra refuses the terms.
- **Chapter 30: The Quartet's Discovery & The Unveiling (`30.md`)**: The quartet surfaces proof; Lyra acts inside the machine, not around it.
- **Chapter 31: The Breaking Point & The Father's Arrival (`31.md`)**: The system fails loud; Wei arrives into the damage.
- **Chapter 32: The Father's Stand (`32.md`)**: Wei chooses consent and containment over control and denial.
- **Chapter 33: The Father's Light & The Weave's Response (`33.md`)**: The Weave shifts state; the story turns toward aftermath instead of spectacle.

## Notes
- Keep the scene math clear; avoid explaining the theme after the scene already proved it.
