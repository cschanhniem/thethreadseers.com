# Chapter 29: The Price of Life

The lab had dropped from alternating amber to one continuous tone that drilled through molars.
In that sound, nobody talked about next week; they counted in short bites.

Harlow guided Lyra into the inner lab and pulled up a live medical feed.

Wei Chen's neural cascade was no longer theoretical. The line stepped down in small, relentless drops.
The monitor beeped with the same indifferent rhythm as any hospital machine, and Lyra hated it for being familiar.
Each drop tightened something under her ribs.

"You have less than a day," Harlow said. "Maybe a full day with aggressive suppression."

Lyra stared at the monitor.
For a second she saw Wei the last time she left him, making himself smile through exhaustion, pretending it was still a choice.

"How long have you been tracking him?"

"Since the bookstore event. I needed a chart that cornered you before anyone else could."

"You mean leverage."

Harlow didn't deny it.

"I delayed the alert," he said.
"To do what?" Lyra asked.
"To make sure you were the one who answered."
He kept his eyes on the feed. "I've watched people stretch bad news into something polite. It doesn't change the ending. It just wastes the minutes you still have."

* * *

Harlow opened a second display: collapse projections, fracture spread, city-level casualty curves.

"The Convergence Protocol can do two things at once," he said. "Sever your father's sympathetic bleed and phase-lock the local matrix. One anchor. One operation."

"One kid in the chair," Lyra said.
Her voice came out thin; if it warmed, she'd hear herself agree.

"One person in the chair," he replied, watching her carefully. "You walk out alive. You can hate me after."

"And my father?"

"Stabilized if your merge holds. Dead by morning if it doesn't."

Lyra laughed once, no sound in it.

"You put students in crystal cages. Don't use that word with me."

Harlow's jaw tightened.

"The early runs were cruelty," he said. "Say it with your whole chest, if you need me to. Cruelty."
He swallowed. "And the window still closes whether we're ready or not."

He brought up a simulation branch. Without anchor, the model ended in chain failure by dawn.

"You're the only bridge that will hold," he said. "I'm not asking you to like it. I'm telling you what the system will do if we don't hold it."

"Then show me everything," Lyra said. "No pitch. Everything."

Harlow hesitated, then activated a crystalline playback block stamped with Lin's credentials.

The lab around her shifted into reconstructed memory:
Air thickened. Metal and old antiseptic. Panic trapped in the vents.

Lin Chen at the chamber threshold, radiant and furious.
Harlow younger, unscarred, trying to hold procedure around panic.

"Direct contact may not be reversible," Harlow in the recording said.

"Neither is the damage if we do nothing," Lin answered.

"Wei doesn't know you're escalating to live merge."

"Wei knows the risk profile," Lin said. "He doesn't know I stopped waiting for the Council to catch up."

She looked straight into the recorder.

"If this fails," she said, "don't let grief become permission."

Then she stepped into resonance.

Light swallowed the chamber.
The recording fractured on her scream.
A burst of static spat from the speakers. Then the lab was only the lab again.

Playback ended mid-scream. The rest was blank.
Lyra's fingers twitched toward the crystalline block before she caught herself, and she hated that she still wanted to know what came after.

* * *

Lyra folded her hands behind her back and waited for the twitch in her fingers to pass.

"She warned you," she said. "And you did it anyway."

Harlow's eyes stayed on the dead crystal.

"I know."

"Why?"

He took a breath and it didn't look like relief.

"I watched eight minutes turn into forty-three bodies," he said. "Long enough that 'wait' stopped sounding neutral."

Lyra shook her head.

"You picked who gets crushed and wrote the justification before the floor stopped shaking."

He finally looked at her.

"When collapse hits, somebody gets pinned under it."

"Then take the weight," Lyra said. "Don't tie it to a kid and call it care."

* * *

Harlow moved his hand to the console.

"If you walk out now, your father dies and this structure follows him."

Lyra forgot how to swallow.
Her hands tingled with the urge to reach for the console, to grab the lever he had placed in front of her and pull until the line stopped dropping.
Her thumb found the activation ridge before she noticed.
She jerked her hand back like the metal had burned her.
She hated that her body understood the appeal.

She thought of Wei in a hospital bed, keeping his voice steady so she could borrow it.
She thought of Milo hitting the floor in Hall Seven.
She thought of Lin's voice in that recorder: *don't let grief become permission.*

"Then I walk out with my name," she said, and heard how thin it sounded in her own mouth. "If this tears, it tears with names."

"There is no other way."

"There is no other way you can stand and still call it rescue."

Alarms started in the walls.

Harlow's field rose around his hands, silver threads thickening the air.

"I cannot let you leave," he said quietly.

Lyra lifted her chin.

"Then do it without bolts."

The lab shuddered as the first major fracture hit the lower foundations.
