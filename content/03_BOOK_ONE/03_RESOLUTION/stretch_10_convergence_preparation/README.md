# Stretch 10: Convergence Preparation (Resolution Arc)

## Purpose
Immediate aftermath: custody, evidence transfer, survival triage, and the first real step toward institutional accountability.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 34: The Aftermath & Harlow's Reckoning (`34.md`)**: Council teams arrive; records are handed over without bargaining; complicity is named out loud.

## Notes
- Keep "reckoning" procedural and specific; avoid spiritualizing repair.
