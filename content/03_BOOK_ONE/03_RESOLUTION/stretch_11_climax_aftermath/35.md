# Chapter 35: The Choice to Heal

By hearings week, the blood was gone from Sub-level 7 and still in the room by smell.
Administrators called it stable. Survivors called it survivable.
Lyra called it scar. The Weave under the Academy still ran warm, but it no longer moved like silk. It caught.

One week later, the emergency inquiry met in Convocation Hall under full Council authority.

Marcus Harlow sat inside a containment lattice in plain restraint bands, stripped of rank and clearance.
A survivor in the second row watched until the restraint bands locked, then stayed standing anyway.
When the presiding elder read the first list of names, someone whispered along in time. The hall had learned the script before the Council did.

Lyra, Milo, Zara, and Eli gave testimony in sequence.
So did staff members who had kept silent too long.
One student from Hall Seven testified through a privacy screen and said Lyra's voice was in his head the night the matrix broke.
Lyra did not challenge the statement.
She wrote his name on her pad and did not write "recovered" beside it.
In the corridor afterward, Milo hummed a calibration note by reflex. The same student turned toward the sound and asked who was singing.

Harlow provided the records without bargaining: unauthorized severance logs, Conduit logs, Syndicate contact chains, student impact files.
He also filed one supplemental statement under oath: his manual shutdown in Sub-level 7 prevented automated secondary pull from sweeping adjacent sectors.
Three med officers confirmed the claim and none of them called it redemption.

When the presiding elder asked whether he disputed criminal accountability, he answered once.

"No."

He did not speak about intent.
He did not ask to be understood.

By the third hour, clerks were taping addenda over older drafts because every clause had been contested in public.
The final order stripped Harlow's badge and clearance in open session. Security boxed his lab keys in tamper tape while the clerk read seizure and restitution into record. Tribunal referral followed after student stabilization windows closed.

No applause followed the vote.
One elder walked out before signing. Another signed and filed dissent in the same motion. Clerks recorded the order anyway.

After adjournment, Lyra requested five monitored minutes with Harlow.

He looked smaller without the control room around him. Sleep deprivation had sharpened his face; guilt was still arriving.
Thread-sight kept offering her an easy theft: reach, read, decide. She kept her hands on the table instead. Thread-silence, even here.

"I am not here to absolve you," Lyra said.
"I'm here because I wake up in your room and I'm done paying rent there."

He nodded.

"I'm setting terms for myself. Process can keep your file. You don't get my nights."

"Understood," he said.

"If you want any form of repair," she continued, "start with facts. Full log. Nothing polished."

His eyes dropped to the table.

"I can do that much," he said.

"Do it daily," Lyra said. "Write it before anyone can clean it."

Harlow looked at her then, really looked.
"You used force for one beat in Sub-level 7," he said quietly. "I saw it."
He inhaled once. "That beat kept people alive."
Lyra met his eyes and didn't blink.
"Yes," she said. "I reached for the lever before I reached for him."
"And Milo hit the floor for it."
Her fingers closed once, empty, the console's shape still in the joints.
"I'm done pretending that beat doesn't belong to me."

She stood, gave him a brief nod, and left.

That evening, the four of them met at Wei Chen's marker in the memorial garden.

Milo's hearing still clipped under emotional load.
Zara still had to down-regulate after crowds.
Eli still slept in short tactical cycles.
Lyra still woke at 3:00 AM when the old alarms replayed in her head.

"We're functional," Milo said. "Not fine."

When Lyra reached for his shoulder, Milo flinched before he could stop himself. He exhaled hard, ashamed and angry at the same time.
"Not at you," he said. "At what my body remembers."

"Functional is a start," Eli said.

Zara touched the stone marker with two fingers.
"Healing doesn't mean pretending this was clean."

Lyra looked toward the rebuilt East Wing.

"No," she said. "It means next time the first lock fails, someone yells before a kid learns the hard way."

At the first curfew bell, Milo looked up and said, "Why are we still out here?"
Then his eyes found Wei's name on the stone and the question broke on him.
"Right," he said, voice gone small. "Sorry."

They stood there until the second bell, four people in partial repair, coats damp with night mist and no appetite for speeches.
