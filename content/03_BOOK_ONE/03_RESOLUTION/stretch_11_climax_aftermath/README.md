# Stretch 11: Climax Aftermath (Resolution Arc)

## Purpose
Close the immediate crisis with process: inquiry, sanctions, survivor repair, and the quartet choosing a future that is not denial.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 35: The Choice to Heal (`35.md`)**: Emergency inquiry; testimony; sanctions; Lyra sets terms for herself and for any repair.
- **Chapter 36: The Thread Continues (`36.md`)**: Memorial and renewal; the quartet's paths stay distinct without breaking the bond.

## Notes
- Keep the tone restrained; let consequences and small acts carry the ending weight.
