# Chapter 36: The Thread Continues

Silence arrived first as the absence of alarms, then as a habit nobody trusted.

* * *

Six weeks after the Convergence, Threadweaver Academy held its first Memorial and Renewal Ceremony.

The hall was arranged in a circle, no raised platform, no single lineage in the center.

Lyra spoke first.

"We're not here to polish what happened," she said. "Count the empty chairs."

Headmistress Weaver read from pages swollen with edits and thumbed soft at the corners, each clause tagged in the margin with a student's name and two kinds of ink.
She didn't list promises. She read constraints: who could say no, who got to see, who would be paid before the building got bigger.

By clause seven, one elder walked out. By clause nine, a parent stood and called it too little.
The vote still passed with two dissents and four abstentions.
The parent who had stood left her pen on the floor and did not pick it up.

No applause followed, only quiet agreement and one row of families leaving early before the signatures dried.
One recovered student thanked the friend who had carried him out and used his full name like they had never skipped class together.
Ten minutes later, he thanked the same friend again and did not notice he was repeating himself.

That afternoon, they opened the Lin Chen Memorial Library.

Its rooms held paper archives, oral repositories, tactile stacks, and harmonic records side by side. Nothing was labeled secondary.
Some spines were blank except for numbers and a date; absence got cataloged, too.

At the dedication, Weaver read a line from Wei Chen's final journal entry:

"Stop sorting wisdom by accent. Teach the next generation to listen before they classify."

Lyra stood with one hand on the plaque. The low, steady pressure of the rebuilt Weave rose through the floor.
It touched back, warm as a palm pressed to stone, rough as healed skin.
The old scream in the foundation wasn't gone. It had been compressed into a difficult, stubborn hum.

That night, the quartet met in the old common room.

Milo had accepted placement at the Vienna Conservatory's dimensional acoustics program.
Performance track had refused him after the post-Convergence audiogram. He took restoration work instead.

Zara was returning to Ghana for advanced family-line healing training before rejoining the Academy as a cross-tradition instructor.

Eli had taken a research post with the International Thread Research Consortium under the new ethics framework, including three labs that had funded Harlow before the collapse.

Lyra would leave for Shanghai to reopen Lin Chen's home study with Professor Li as a satellite school for mixed-heritage seers.

"This isn't goodbye," Milo said.

"No," Lyra said. "This is what we're calling it so it doesn't sound like splitting."

Eli's mouth twitched. "You keep using that like it hurts less."

"Yes," Lyra said. "It is." The lie sat between them and no one offered to fix it.

Zara bumped her shoulder once. "Let her have one bad word."
Milo kept his eyes on Eli, then looked at Lyra.
"Distance still takes a bite at every node."
Eli looked at the floorboards. Zara kept her gaze on the window until the line passed.
"And your new lab still buys old tools," Milo added. He kept his voice even. His hands didn't. "Don't tell me policy fixed that in six weeks."
Eli didn't answer right away. "I'm going there so someone says no in the room before they write code."
Milo gave him a hard look. "Then say it before they ask nicely."
Zara finally looked at Eli. "And if they smile while asking, that's still asking."
No one mentioned the first contract. The silence sat there anyway.

Before dawn, they went to the memorial garden.

Lyra knelt at Wei Chen's marker. The others stood with her in the cold.

When Lyra rose, she reached automatically toward Milo's sleeve.
He flinched, then held up his hand between them.
"Ask first," he said, quiet, not angry.
Lyra nodded. "Can I?"
After a beat, he nodded back.
He offered his wrist, not his shoulder.
Lyra took it with two fingers. The connection held, then snagged, rough, like thread drawn through scar tissue. She didn't tighten her grip.

Lyra looked at the stone and spoke without ceremony.
"If I grab because it gets loud, pull me off."
Milo nodded once, mouth set hard. "I'll yell first. Then I'll pull."
Zara said, "If I start answering for people, interrupt me."
Eli added, "If my report sounds cleaner than tonight, assume I'm lying."
Lyra added, after a long pause, "If I call that second an outlier so I can sleep, don't let me."

No one lifted a hand for a vow. They stood in the cold until Milo's fingers stopped shaking and the first maintenance cart squealed past the gate like any other morning.

When the first bells rang at dawn, the pitch held. From somewhere below the old sub-level seam, Wei's counting rhythm answered once and cut out before the second beat. At first light, East Wing answered back, too clean to trust.
