# Chapter 9: The Silver Burn

Two days after intake orientation, the train climbed through mist toward Threadweaver Academy.

Lyra kept one hand on the pendant and tried not to think about the hospital monitor numbers from the night before.
Wei was stable, but only if "stable" now meant "declining more slowly."

"Rough trip home?" a girl across the aisle asked.

Crisp uniform, upper-year confidence.

"Is it that obvious?"

"Always is," the girl said. "I'm Mina. Third-year resonance track."

"Lyra. First-year. Late awakening."

Mina nodded, immediately practical. "Primary modality?"

"Visual. Multi-layer."

"Rare." Mina leaned in. "Most of us get narrow-band reads. If your range opens too wide at once, run blue-filter first. Narrow, then widen."

Lyra stored that away.

Below the station canopy, terraced gardens stepped toward the river in precise green bands, and the Loom Tower caught morning sun like hammered brass.
For a moment, the Academy looked like the brochure.
Then amber warning light washed the glass, and everyone looked at their shoes.

On the shuttle, Security Chief Blackwood checked every document herself.

Mina whispered without moving her lips: "Do not improvise around her."

Lyra pulled her papers from her sketchbook. A folded rice-paper note slipped out, crimson-sealed on Chief Blackwood stationery.

Mina caught the crest and stopped blinking. "Where did you get that?"

"I didn't." Lyra unfolded it.

The note was brief and transactional, written in shorthand that assumed the reader already agreed:

> Council channels ineffective.  
> Syndicate acceleration viable.  
> Magnus Conduit progressing.  
> Chen profile marked Alpha if Animus Argenti confirmed.

Lyra refolded it with fingers that wouldn't hold steady.

"Destroy it," Mina whispered.

Bootsteps sounded behind them.
Lyra slid the note back into the sketchbook.

Chief Blackwood stopped at their row. "Identification."

Lyra handed over her Academy acceptance letter.

Chief Blackwood read the name, looked up. "Any relation to Professor Lin Chen?"

"My mother," Lyra said, and waited through the silence that followed.

"Welcome to Threadweaver Academy, Ms. Chen," Chief Blackwood said, and moved on.

Lyra didn't breathe normally again until the inner gates closed behind them.

The Academy banners hung over impact glass and blast shutters.
It looked less like a school than a place rehearsing two futures at once.

Three days later, Harlow lectured in Lumina Hall.

He spoke in the dry dialect of risk charts: where to cut first, who counted as acceptable spill, which losses could be buried under words like stabilization.
Then he said the line that froze the room.

"In some cases, protective severance is the ethical option."

For one coward second, Lyra pictured Wei walking out of ICU and wanted the sentence to be true.
Then she remembered Ben in the corridor touching his own throat, searching for a missing joke.

Milo's knee knocked hers under the bench; Eli closed his notebook mid-sentence. When Q&A opened, Eli nudged her.
"Ask him."

Lyra raised her hand.
"Where do you put the part that isn't clean?" she asked. "The texture. The tone. The way a room goes wrong before anyone admits it."

Harlow fixed on her at once.
"Useful if disciplined and logged," he said. "Do certain artifacts or bloodline objects increase your resolution, Miss..."

"Chen," Lyra said.

"Miss Chen. Track all outlier response events."

The answer was public.
The target selection was private.

After lecture, he intercepted her near the aisle.

"Your resolution is uncommon," he said.

As he turned, his fingers brushed her forearm.

Silver pain shot up her arm like a forced current, not static, not heat: transfer. Lyra staggered, and Milo caught her elbow.

Harlow watched one extra second. "Apologies." Then he walked away.

Lyra's Academy tablet chimed.
A banner filled the screen:

> Wei Chen  
> Westbrook Neurological Institute - Room 247  
> Cardiac event at 15:47  
> Immediate family contact required

The tablet slipped from her hand and struck stone.

For a moment, Lyra couldn't move.
The hallway noise blurred into one long, useless sound.

Zara was there before Lyra registered her move, palm set between Lyra's shoulder blades like a firm hinge.
"Breathe," she said, simple and sharp. "Right now."

Milo picked the tablet up with careful hands and held it out without commentary.
His face had gone pale in the way he usually saved for off-key disaster.

Eli was already pulling up a call screen.
"Do you have a direct line?" he asked. "If not, I can at least keep you from being on hold."

Lyra took the tablet back.
Her thumb shook as she hit call.

It rang twice before a nurse answered.

"Westbrook Neuro, Room 247."

"This is Lyra Chen," Lyra said. "I'm his daughter. Is he alive?"

A pause. Paper shuffling. Voices behind the line.

"He coded," the nurse said. "We got him back. He's in ICU. Dr. Vasquez wants to speak to you as soon as she can."

Lyra closed her eyes hard enough to hurt.
Relief didn't come. The fear only moved, from done to waiting, and ICU was a place made of waiting.

"Thank you," she managed.

When she hung up, Milo let out one shaky breath like he'd been holding it for her.

Zara didn't soften. "Okay," she said. "You're not fine. Don't pretend you are."

Eli nodded once. "We find you somewhere quiet. We get updates. We keep moving until you tell us to stop."

Lyra looked down at her hands, then up at the corridor ahead.
Wei was alive, and the thread between them had just tightened around a new kind of pressure.
