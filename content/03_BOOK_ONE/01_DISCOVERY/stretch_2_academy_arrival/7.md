# Chapter 7: The Father's Shadow

By midnight, the clinic corridor smelled like bleach and wet wool, panic scrubbed down to procedure.

Security Chief Mirembe Blackwood stood outside recovery room three and watched Priya's breathing settle.
The first-year's panic response had settled after grounding: floor texture, pulse count, ceiling grid, repeat.
No dramatic rescue, just procedure.

Nurse Thorne came out with a chart and a tired smile.
"You got her down fast."

"She's resilient," Chief Blackwood said.

Thorne lowered her voice.
"Whole intake is fraying this week. Too many incidents."

She moved on before Chief Blackwood answered.

The corridor emptied.
Chief Blackwood stepped to the med console, palmed the maintenance seam, and slid in a wafer-thin chip wrapped in a cloaking weave.

Target query: thread degradation, severance interventions, unreported memory effects.

Auto-erase after twelve hours.

Her wrist charm warmed once as the injection took.
Then cooled.

Public role: Security Chief.
Private task: collect what the official record would not retain.

Elara's name had landed on her desk three weeks ago, on an internal roster refresh.
Her younger sister was now inside the same institution Chief Blackwood no longer trusted to tell the full truth.

That changed the risk math.

She left the corridor with her usual measured pace, no sign she had done anything except stand watch.

Harlow's office lights were still on when most of the Academy had gone dark.

A child's drawing lay open on his desk: five cherry blossoms in wax pencil, lettered in uneven strokes.

*For Daddy, so you remember spring when you're working too late.*

He kept one finger on the paper while reading two live files.

Lyra Chen: late awakening, multi-spectrum drift, silver signal escalation.

Wei Chen: neural load rising, sympathetic bleed accelerating, critical window narrowing.

A secure channel pinged.

*Syndicate watchers active in outer sectors. Chen profile flagged Alpha-priority by two independent cells.*

Harlow read it twice, deleted the route header, and opened a fresh surveillance map.

On another screen, a replay from the bookstore incident looped: Ben collapsing, severance, recovery.

Necessary, he told himself.
Still harm.

He looked at the drawing again.
Kyoto remained in his body as reflex: act first, explain later, regret in private.

At 1:43 AM, another encrypted note arrived from the medical wing.

*Wei Chen deterioration trending steeper. Bridge window shortening.*

Harlow sat back and closed his eyes for exactly three breaths.

Then he reopened Lyra's profile and marked it with a single internal flag:

*protective watch - continuous*

Not because the Academy had asked or the Council had approved.

Because every path ahead now crossed the same line:
if he delayed, others would choose for her.

His finger had been on the drawing too long. When he lifted it, one blossom came up smudged.

On another screen, Ben collapsed again and sat up again. Alive, and not whole.
