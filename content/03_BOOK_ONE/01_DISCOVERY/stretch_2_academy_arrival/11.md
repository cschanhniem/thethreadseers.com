# Chapter 11: The Magnus Conduit

Over the Maze gate, amber warning light pulsed faster than normal.

Tanaka called names from a slate while first-years waited at the Maze gate.
Somewhere under the stone, the Academy hummed like a machine trying to sound like a mountain.

When Lyra heard "Chen, Lyra," Milo leaned in.
"Late awakeners usually spike in there. Don't let the system set your pace."

"Helpful," she said.

"I try."

Tanaka lowered her voice as Lyra stepped forward.
"The Maze reflects perception pressure. Trust what you sense, not what looks impressive."

The archway closed behind her.

Inside, the first chambers looked like lessons and traps sharing the same blueprint.
One room grew thread-lilies out of stone when she slowed her breathing enough to notice them. The next asked her to map emotional current while moving walls tried to break her timing.
Chalk dust clung to her fingertips. The air tasted faintly of copper whenever she guessed wrong.

By chamber seven, the geometry changed. The room looked empty, with no obvious route.

"Perception test," the house voice said. "Find the unseen path."

Lyra stopped trying to force visual readouts and switched to pressure sensing: tiny changes in air resistance, temperature seams, thread drag at skin level.
She let her eyes go soft and listened with her hands.

A pathway appeared in pulses, and she followed it.

Halfway through, the room destabilized and the standard pattern dropped.
A second route surfaced in silver filaments she had not seen anywhere else in the Maze.
They didn't look like the other pathways. They held steady under her attention, indifferent to the Maze's timing.

The house voice went flat. "Unclassified silver pathway detected."

Lyra took it.

A deeper chamber opened, older architecture with fewer Academy signatures.

At center sat a crystal fragment holding low silver light.

"Restricted access," the voice said. "Signature match: Chen, Lin. Prior access recorded."

Lyra froze.
"My mother was here." The words made her throat tighten, like saying them out loud might make the Maze take them back.

"Confirmed."

The silver line in her chest pulled toward the fragment.
It wasn't curiosity exactly. It was gravity.

"Animus Argenti fragment," the voice said. "Bridge remnant."

She stepped closer.
Red warning glyphs slammed across the walls.

The house voice returned, flat:

> Maze stability compromised. Emergency exit protocol engaged.

The pedestal began retracting.
Lyra lunged.

A maintenance compartment snapped open below it, rolled documents inside.

She grabbed one as the compartment sealed.
A red exit gate flared to life.
She ran.

In the courtyard, Tanaka was waiting.
Chief Blackwood stood behind her, not looking at the Maze, looking at Lyra.

"Are you hurt?" Tanaka asked.

Lyra slid the roll into her satchel and kept her breathing flat.
"No."

"Seven chambers before interruption," Tanaka said. "Strong first run."

Officially seven. Unofficially more.

Chief Blackwood held Lyra's gaze for a long moment, gave one sharp nod, and walked away.

Lyra chose one question.
"The Maze invoked Animus Argenti and linked it to Lin Chen."

Tanaka's expression tightened by a fraction.
"Work from the worst year on record," Tanaka said. "Half-built, half-buried. The Maze still coughs it up."

True, maybe, but incomplete.

Milo emerged laughing, sweat-soaked and triumphant.
"Nine chambers. I am accepting applause now."

Tanaka clapped once and started debrief. Voices rose, questions collided, and whatever space Lyra had to think got filled with other people's relief.

The roll knocked her hip out of tempo with her own pulse each step she took.

---

She opened it after lights-out with curtains drawn.

It was a blueprint, dense engineering layers: extraction conduits, stabilization loops, conversion architecture.
Ink and old paper, rolled tight under panic. Her fingers left smudges where someone else had gripped too hard.

At the top, in heavy type: *Magnus Conduit - Phase 1 Implementation.* Below it, a signature: *M. Harlow.* In the margins, a second hand in fast Chinese script she recognized before she could translate it. Lin Chen.

Lyra translated line by line:

> **[BLUEPRINT | Magnus Conduit, Phase 1 | Signature: M. Harlow | Marginalia: Lin Chen]**
>
> Thus entered into record:
> *If this runs on force, it will keep feeding on students.*
>
> *They'll stamp "stabilization" on the folder while children gray out in the chair.*
>
> *It will hold. It will catch.*
>
> *Ask first. Never seize.*
>
> *Do not rename people into parts.*
>
> *Stability always charged interest.*
>
> (Final margin note, written under visible time pressure; the paper tears where the pen pressed too hard.)
> *If I wait for permission, they'll bury this in procedure. I am late. I still go.*
>
> **[End marginalia]**

Lyra stared until the letters blurred.
Whatever the cost, it had never sounded like philosophy when her mother wrote it. It sounded like a decision made too late.
For one hard second Lyra wanted the opposite to be true, wanted force to be ugly but fast and therefore useful, because fast looked like her father alive.

Lyra rolled the blueprint and hid it under a loose board beneath her bed.

Questions replaced sleep: how many phases existed, who authorized them, who knew Lin opposed the project, who buried the record.

Near midnight, a silhouette appeared on the admin tower balcony.
Chief Blackwood.
Still for exactly one minute, then gone.

Lyra kept one hand on the pendant and watched darkness thin toward dawn.

A soft tone came from her bedside monitor.
The screen lit with a red icon.

Then alarms started across campus.
Her monitor chimed again, sharper. Two words scrolled across the display: Hall Seven.
The pendant went cold enough to hurt.
