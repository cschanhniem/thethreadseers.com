# Chapter 5: The Severance

The Iris Bookstore had been rearranged into a temporary briefing hall: folding chairs, portable projectors, staff with polite faces and emergency exits unobstructed.

Lyra sat between Wei's rigid silence and Nai Nai's deliberate calm.

At the front, Headmistress Weaver spoke with measured clarity.

"Threadweaver Academy is not here to replace family judgment," she said. "We're here to train awakened students before what they see starts hurting them or everyone near them."

Lyra watched the room instead of the stage.
Parents trying not to look afraid.
Students keeping their faces blank.
Security Chief Blackwood near the back wall, scanning people the way other adults scanned floor plans.

Nai Nai leaned closer.
"Watch who watches," she murmured.

Lyra did.
Harlow stood offstage, still enough to vanish if you didn't look straight at him.

A heavy thud interrupted Weaver mid-sentence.

A Westbrook boy in the second row dropped hard to the floor.
For a half second no one moved; then chairs scraped, voices rose, someone shouted for medical staff.

Lyra's perception flared.
Fear, confusion, urgency everywhere.
Her pulse jumped into her throat, loud as a warning bell.
And one thread she had never seen before attached to the collapsed boy:
ashen black-silver,
not dim but hollow.
It looked less like shadow and more like something burned out from the inside.

"Ben!" someone yelled from the aisle.

The front door banged open. Dayo Okafor came in rain-soaked and furious.

"Third collapse this week," he said. "Maya Rodriguez. Sam Chen. Now Ben. How many before somebody says what this is?"

The room quieted around the accusation.

"Everyone give space," Weaver said.

Harlow moved first.
He knelt beside Ben, touched two fingers to the boy's forehead, and extended a narrow gray filament from his own field.

Contact hit behind Lyra's eyes like pressure before a nosebleed.
The fluorescent buzz dropped half a note and held. The room clenched.
Then the black-silver line snapped.

No light, no sound, just a clean break.
The absence rang anyway, a silent concussion that left her stomach briefly weightless.
For one breath, the floor tiles became cobblestone. Boots. Wet rope biting skin.
Then it was tile again, and the boy on the floor was alive and missing.

Ben convulsed once, drew in air, and opened his eyes.
Color returned in slow increments.
A wave of relief moved through the room like heat off asphalt, and Lyra felt it too.
That was the worst part: her body wanted to be grateful.
Dayo grabbed Ben's shoulder and said his name.
Ben blinked at him, polite and blank a fraction too long, then recovered and called him "bro" like he'd found the line late.

Harlow stood.
"Acute overload. He's stable."

Lyra stared at him.
It had looked precise, practiced, and nothing like medicine.
It had also worked.

As staff moved Ben toward the back room, Harlow stopped in front of Lyra.

"You have your mother's eyes," he said.

The sentence landed before she could brace.

"You knew Lin Chen?"

"Closely," he said. "We worked together before she disappeared."

His gaze dropped to the pendant at Lyra's throat and returned.

"Your signal is activating quickly," he said. "Faster than is safe without guidance."

"Professor," Weaver called from the doorway. "Dr. Vasquez is ready."

In the back room, Dr. Elena Vasquez already had Wei's scans open on a monitor.

"Your scans don't match ordinary disease," she said. "Your nervous system is taking signal load it cannot carry for long."

Wei looked up once. "Plain language."

"Your daughter's activation is riding the bond and stressing your system," Vasquez said. "Closer bond, heavier load."

Metal taste hit Lyra's tongue.
She gripped the table so hard her knuckles blanched; the monitor glow and her father's face refused to stay in the same frame.

"So I'm hurting him by existing."
The words came out flat, like she was reading someone else's diagnosis.

"I'm saying this is measurable and progressing," Vasquez replied. "Without intervention, yes, it can become fatal."

Silence held long enough for the monitor beep to sound accusatory.

Wei found Lyra's hand and held on.
His grip was steady, an anchor set with intention.

"Did Lin show similar markers?" he asked.

"Related profile," Vasquez said.

Harlow set a folder on the table.

"There are mitigation options," he said. "But choice requires full context."

Inside the folder: Lin's field notes, collapse imagery, and a charcoal drawing of cherry blossoms darkened at the edges.
Initialed **M.H.**
A line beneath it in tight script:
*For Mei - remember the beauty before the burning.*

"Kyoto, 1997," Harlow said.

Lyra looked up.

"I lost my wife and daughter there," he continued. "Not to death. To erasure."

Wei's voice roughened. "What are you offering?"

"A trade-off," Harlow said, looking at Lyra. "Dampen your active expression and buy your father time, or keep full thread-sight and accept faster decline."

Lyra heard the trap immediately: whichever path she chose, she'd carry the consequence as personal fault.
But she also heard the other thing underneath it, raw and undeniable.
*There is a lever. You can pull it. Your father might get time.*
Her hand tightened around Wei's without permission.

"There has to be another route," she said.

"Then find it quickly," Harlow replied.

When the meeting broke, the bookstore resumed ordinary noise: cups, doorbells, muted voices.
The table in front of Lyra did not.

Ben had collapsed and stood up changed.
Her father was getting worse.
Her mother had left warnings in ink no one had acted on in time.

Outside, someone laughed near the register like this was a normal Saturday.
Lyra felt the reflex to answer it, then Wei's grip tightened, small and involuntary, and she swallowed the sound.
At Lyra's table, urgency sat in a folder with signatures.
Under that, the memory of the silent snap stayed lodged in her ribs, sharp and unprovable.
