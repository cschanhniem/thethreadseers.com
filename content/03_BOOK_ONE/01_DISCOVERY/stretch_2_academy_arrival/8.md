# Chapter 8: The Pressure Cooker

Orientation in Westbrook had reached the predictable part: name badges, policy slides, polite anxiety. The Academy had rented the civic hall for intake day and dressed it in calm language.

> **[INTAKE DAY | POLICY SLIDE (EXCERPT) | Civic Hall]**

> Thus entered into record:
> "Threadweaver Academy respects consent and family judgment."
> "Thread-silence requests are honored when safety permits."
> "In emergency conditions, staff instructions override individual preference until stabilization is achieved."
> (The last two lines were in smaller type.)

For ten minutes, calm almost held.
Two second-years at the front braided thin light across a suspended frame until a valley map bloomed in the air, each district line held by a different hand.
Parents applauded because it looked like education and not triage.

Then the alarm hit.

The siren barked three clipped words through the hall speakers: breach, quake, positions.

A hardcase rig at the front unfolded into a crystalline matrix and pinned itself to the floor.
Harlow's voice cut through the noise from a speaker overhead.

"All students with active perception, extend to the matrix. Containment now."

Lyra reached before she meant to, and the matrix caught her silver channel and pulled hard.

Light surged. Every thread in the room flared too bright, and students screamed, covered their ears, dropped to their knees.

Lyra tried to disengage and couldn't. The feedback loop kept climbing.

"Hey. Eyes on me." A boy beside her had dark curls and a steady voice. "Breathe with me. Four in, four hold, four out."

She caught his rhythm and held it by force.

"Milo," he said. "Names later. Stay on the beat."

A girl moved to Lyra's left and anchored one hand at her shoulder blade.
"I'm Zara," she said. "You're spilling panic into the room. Let me carry some so it doesn't take everyone with it."

A thin boy with rectangular glasses appeared on Lyra's right, scanning the matrix like it was a math problem.
"Eli," he said. "We can phase the output. Milo, keep tempo. Lyra, only ease down on the exhale."

"What number?" Milo asked.

"Four-three-two."

"Of course it's 432," Milo muttered, then adjusted his count and started tapping the pulse against Lyra's wrist.

Zara held her steady while Eli called corrections and Milo kept time.

Lyra stopped fighting the matrix and redirected flow in measured steps instead of one hard cut.

The hall light dropped from white-out to amber, then to normal.

Students around them straightened slowly, breathing hard, shaken but upright. No secondary collapse.

Harlow approached, expression unreadable.

"Interesting adaptive response," he said.

He was looking at all four of them, not just Lyra.

After staff cleared the hall, the four stood off to one side with adrenaline still shaking through their hands.

"That was a terrible first impression," Lyra said.

"I've had worse openings," Milo said.

Zara gave Lyra a flat look that softened at the edges.
"Next time you go that bright, give me a second first. I can hold a room; I can't hold a stampede."

"Noted."

Eli was already replaying data on his tablet.
"Your channel isn't unstable," Eli said. "It's uncalibrated. Difference matters."

Milo lifted a brow.
"Was that your version of encouragement?"

"Yes," Eli said.

Lyra laughed once despite herself.
The sound surprised all of them.

"They're going to make us do that again tomorrow, aren't they," Zara said.

"Probably," Milo replied.

"Then we don't do it alone," Lyra said.

No one made a speech. Milo grabbed his case, Zara took point, Eli kept glancing back to count them, and Lyra matched their pace.

By dusk, two second-years in the corridor called them "that unit from orientation."
Milo didn't slow down.

"We're not a unit," he said. "Units don't panic-breathe in public."
He looked at the three of them, then rolled his eyes at himself.
"Quartet. Happy now?"

Nobody argued with that.
Above them, an intake camera iris contracted with a soft click.
None of them looked up.
