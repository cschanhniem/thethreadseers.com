# Chapter 10: The Gauntlet

Amber warning light bled along the edge of the training grounds, the Academy's polite way of saying everyone should move faster.
First-years stood in clumps: sharing contraband sugar bread, checking borrowed gloves, arguing about whose dorm coffee tasted least like metal.

Professor Tanaka waited at the edge of the training grounds while first-years assembled in uneven lines.

"Today is practical integration," she said. "You pass as teams or not at all."

Lyra stood with Milo, Zara, and Eli at the mouth of the course.
Her phone had been quiet since the ICU call.
Quiet wasn't comfort. It was waiting.
A nurse had texted at 4:03: *stable for now*.
Lyra kept rereading *for now* until it looked counterfeit.

"Seven stations," Eli said, already scanning route geometry. "Each tuned to a different failure mode."

"So this is a stress test dressed up as teamwork," Zara said.

"It's a collaboration test," Milo said. "Call it whatever lets Tanaka sleep."

Lyra watched the first group enter and immediately lose timing.

"That's the same thing," she said.

The mirror maze showed each student the shortest path to panic.

Lyra saw her father's line go flat and her own silver channel flare too bright to hold.
Milo heard his count vanish mid-bar, the second row waiting in silence for the note that never came.
Eli watched the solution set close only when his name was treated as noise.
Zara felt twenty panics hit at once, all of them arriving through her throat.

"Don't argue with the mirrors," Eli said. "They scale with resistance."

"Follow pulse instead of image," Milo said, tapping count against the wall.

A second group froze two chambers over.
Their reflections had pinned them in recursive fear loops.

"We're not leaving them," Lyra said.

Milo moved first.
Eli swore under his breath and followed.
Zara nodded once and reached for the nearest trailing line.

A harmony bridge waited at the next gate. It held only if tempo, structure, and emotional load stayed coherent.

Milo carried lead rhythm.
Eli locked interval math.
Zara damped panic spikes in the group behind them.
Lyra held the central amplitude and redistributed overflow when the bridge flickered.

Halfway across, someone behind them stumbled and yanked the line sideways. The bridge sagged, light skittering along the edges like a warning.

Eli's eyes snapped to the nearest node. "Cut the tail or this bridge folds."

Zara turned, already reaching back with her field. "If we cut them, they drop."

Milo's tempo hitched. "Then we don't cut them."

"We can't carry everyone," Eli said.
His voice sharpened on the last word, fear wearing the shape of arithmetic.

Each time their voices rose, two nearby nodes dimmed and the bridge pitched under their shoes.

"What's in reach, we carry," Lyra said. "Milo, steady. Eli, give me a path that holds. Zara, one boundary at a time."

They recalibrated on the move: Milo's count returned, Eli shifted the interval math to widen margin, and Zara stopped trying to hold the whole group at once.

They got everyone across, but the last step landed with a tremor that told Lyra they'd paid for it in load.
One of the students they hauled over shoved Eli's shoulder and said, "You were going to drop us."
Eli absorbed it without answer and never looked back at the bridge.

On the far platform, Eli exhaled hard. "Next time we pick one group and live with it."

Zara didn't look at him. "Next time you say that to their faces."

"You volunteered our blood before asking," Eli said to Lyra. His voice stayed even. His hands didn't.
Lyra held his stare. "Then yell at me while we run. Just don't go quiet."

Milo wiped sweat off his palm on his pants. "Great. First friend fight of the semester. We should print shirts."

The empathy well came next, Zara's station and the worst one for her.

"I lose edge in here," she said at the lip.

"Then we hold edge for you," Lyra answered.

They descended in linked sequence: Zara reading, Eli filtering, Milo pacing, Lyra anchoring.

The well pushed grief, anger, attachment, shame in rapid rotation.
By the time they reached the core marker, all four were shaking.
Zara still retrieved it clean.

After that, a logic labyrinth shifted equations based on group emotional variance.

"It's not a puzzle," Eli said. "It's biofeedback with numbers."

He set breathing cadence, then route order.
Lyra followed his timing calls exactly.
Milo used tone pulses to keep transitions synchronized.
Zara flagged fear spikes before they hit threshold.

They cleared with seconds to spare and pulled two stalled students through the final gate.

By the fifth gate Eli stopped offering options and started assigning them.
Zara followed his calls and kept the argument for later.
At the sixth Milo's count slipped half a beat and Lyra caught it with a shoulder tap before the bridge noticed.
By the seventh they moved on one rhythm, and one bad call would have split them down the middle.

At the final ring, Harlow waited in the last chamber inside a narrow circle of silver light.

"You've improved," he said. "Let's measure whether the bond survives pressure."

He drove a separation pattern through the ring.
It wasn't physical force; it was a targeted nudge at each person's private fracture line.

Lyra felt the message in it: isolate, optimize, discard drag.

"Divide pattern," Eli said through clenched teeth. "It wants us single-thread."

"Stay on the same beat," Milo said.

"Nobody drifts," Zara added. "If you spin out, say it. Don't disappear."

They held formation and mirrored each other's breathing until the pattern lost traction.
Lyra redirected the final wave into the floor lattice and grounded it.

Harlow's expression did not change much.
"Interesting," he said.

Then, quieter to Lyra alone:
"Your mother also called unity safety."

Before she could answer, Tanaka called end-of-run.
Harlow stepped out of the ring and was gone into staff corridors.

Back in the courtyard, their hands still trembled from post-adrenaline drop.

"We just carried half the cohort," Milo said. "On purpose."

"Twelve students across fail points," Eli confirmed.

Zara exhaled. "Let's not make that a habit."

Lyra looked up at the admin tower.
Harlow stood at an upper window for one moment, then turned away.

They had passed the Gauntlet.

None of them believed that meant they were safe.
Less obvious, and harder to admit: none of them trusted each other the exact same way they had at sunrise.
Milo said, "No solos," out of habit. No one echoed it.
