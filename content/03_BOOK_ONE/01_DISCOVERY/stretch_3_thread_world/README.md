# Stretch 3: Thread World (Discovery Arc)

## Purpose
Deepen the thread-world stakes: the Academy's public methods stop looking like "education" and start looking like extraction.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 12: The Kyoto Revelation (`12.md`)**: Demonstration day turns into a trigger; the embedded Harlow section ("THE PRICE OF POWER") exposes thread-burn and the Conduit's real requirements.
- **Chapter 13: The First Disappearance (`13.md`)**: Conflict turns explicit; a disappearance forces the quartet to treat this as urgent and real.
- **Chapter 14: The Magnus Conduit Revealed (`14.md`)**: A collapse and confrontation make it clear the Conduit is not a theory project.

## Notes
- Keep character naming stable: Elara is Elara Blackwood across manuscript and notes.
