# Chapter 13: The First Disappearance

The lab in East Tower still smelled of hot copper and scorched varnish when the argument stopped being academic.

By the door, red warning light washed every face, and even faculty paused before they spoke.

Zara stood opposite Harlow at the obsidian demonstration table, amber defensive threads held low but ready.

"Threads are not ore," she said. "You don't strip a neighborhood and call it stewardship."

Harlow did not raise his voice. "When beams start to shear, nobody votes on feelings. Somebody takes the load."

"That's why it's failing."

A tremor ran the floor hard enough to rattle the suspended copper looms overhead. The red bar crept higher and refused to fall.

Harlow watched the warning light settle, then looked at Lyra.

"Progress," he said, "needs one person who moves before the floor picks victims."

Students filed out in tight, quiet groups; Lyra stayed.

Harlow cleaned instruments with patient, precise movements. Nothing in the room was allowed to shift.

"Ms. Chen," he said without looking up. "Questions?"

"Only one," Lyra said. "Why is your first move always restraints?"

He gave a short smile. "Because I've watched floors come down while committees were still introducing themselves."

Lyra bit the inside of her cheek until iron touched her tongue.
"My mother asked the people in the room first."

"Lin Chen wrote objections," Harlow said. "She also wrote after buildings had already started moving."

That landed harder than Lyra expected.

"She still kept people alive," Lyra said.

"Not all of them." Harlow finally faced her. "Catastrophe doesn't grade on intent."

Silver-blue static crawled over his fingers and vanished.

"Tell me," he said, "what do you know about the Animus Argenti?"

The pendant at Lyra's throat iced against her skin.

"Nothing useful," she said.

He let the silence run long enough to feel like leverage.

"You will," he said. "Soon."

She left with the sensation of a scope between her shoulder blades.

That night she entered the digital archive through a research terminal in Armitage's hall, using an access route Eli had shown her and insisting to herself this was still "cross-reference work," not breach.

Search terms: `dimensional resonance`, `nexus stabilization`, `unconventional transfer`.

Most returns were public theory papers and dead links, until one restricted index fragment surfaced and vanished. Lyra forced a second pull before the gate could close.

She got eight lines, a partial schematic, and two phrases that would not leave her head.

> **[RESTRICTED INDEX FRAGMENT | PARTIAL | auto-shutters triggered]**
>
> Thus entered into record:
> *...controlled dimensional bleed...*
> *...subject viability parameters...*
> *...operator harm probable; feedback loop accelerates under force...*
> (A black bar eats the next line; the word *student* ghosts under it.)
> (Screen-capture saved; auto-shutters triggered mid-line.)

Security shutters dropped on the query. Her session died. The fragment stayed.

At dawn the alarm chain started with a tone reserved for internal disappearance protocols.

The notice named Elara Blackwood, third-year, advanced dynamics: last seen entering her locked dorm room at 23:47, with no exit record and no thread signature on morning sweep, blank where the system should have seen her.

When staff forced the door, the room looked curated, not ransacked: wardrobe emptied, research notes gone, desk surface scrubbed to lacquer. Even her baseline resonance trace had been stripped from the monitor mesh.

The wall seams carried one leftover marker: dimensional fracture residue.
Black-silver.
Fresh enough to sting.

Faculty moved fast and said little while security flooded dorm routes. Harlow was nowhere in East Tower, nowhere in admin logs, nowhere his assistants could "officially" place him.

Lyra found Milo, Zara, and Eli in their library alcove behind the sealed cartography stacks.

"She was in his seminar," Milo said. "Always volunteering for edge-case demos."

Zara's voice stayed low. "I felt a fear spike from north dorms before the alarms. Then nothing."

Eli rotated a slate so all three could see the timeline.
"Door lock says in. Hall camera says no out. Building register says occupant null by 05:12. That's not an accident. That's a system rewrite."

Lyra told them about the file fragment.
Even Milo let the silence stand.

When she finished, Eli exhaled once.
"Then we stop pretending this is rumor and start treating it as hostile architecture."

Milo looked at the floor, then up.
"You think she was taken into a machine."

"I think she was turned into input," Lyra said.

The pendant at her throat gave one hard pulse.
It wasn't panic this time, but warning.

Harlow's question returned in her head: *What do you know about the Animus Argenti?*

The pendant stayed cold against her skin.
