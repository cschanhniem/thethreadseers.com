# Chapter 14: The Magnus Conduit Revealed

Elara Blackwood vanished between evening check-in and dawn roll call.

By breakfast, the Academy posted a three-line notice:
*INTERNAL MATTER UNDER INVESTIGATION.*
Above it, red warning bands chased each other across campus glass, and conversations shortened into clipped whispers.
No details, no timeline, not even her name.

Lyra, Milo, Zara, and Eli met in the student lounge under old battle tapestries that had never looked decorative until this morning.

"It's Harlow," Lyra said.
"Or someone making sure his fingerprints are the only ones we notice."

Milo nodded once. "Her roommate said Elara's been living in restricted stacks. Harlow. The Maze. Old drain-and-stabilize notes. Same three-note chord every night."

"The whole campus feels off," Zara said. "Not panic. More like someone already kicked the door in and we're all pretending we didn't hear it."

Eli was already building a timeline on his slate. "No movement logs after 23:47. Her door register pings her inside. After that, blank sector. That's not a gap. Someone cleaned it."
He looked up at Lyra. "If we accuse before proof, we hand him procedural cover."

They spent the morning pulling threads that snapped in their hands.
Faculty answered in scripted statements. Security routed every question into intake forms. Elara's friends looked frightened enough to lie badly.

In Elara's room, Lyra found notebook stacks, half-finished equations, and the ozone-and-disinfectant smell she had started associating with Harlow's work.

Professor Li passed Lyra in a corridor and did not slow down.

"Be careful," she said. "What's moving under this building is faster than the paperwork meant to stop it."

Then she was gone.

At the end of the hall, Security Chief Mirembe Blackwood watched with the calm face she wore in hearings and raids.

By late afternoon, the Academy had gone quiet in the wrong key. Classes still ran. Students still took notes. But everyone moved in clusters and glanced at exits before sitting down.

Eli kept reading changes aloud in clipped bursts.

"Advanced seminars canceled. Infirmary security tripled. East wing doors cycling manual."

Milo pressed two fingers to his temple. "Background harmonics are climbing. Thin, sharp, unstable."

Zara shut her eyes for a full breath. "Fear, yes. Also expectation. Like people are waiting for the second sound, not the first."

Lyra's pendant heated against her skin.
Then the emergency bells began.

The silver thread in her chest pulled hard to the east.

"Maze," she said.

They ran against evacuation flow and reached the eastern arch to find security already on perimeter.
Inside, thread geometry twisted in sick loops.

A security officer shouted over the alarms. "Dr. Wei Chen is trapped in core sectors. Severe entanglement."

"Elara Blackwood?" Lyra asked.

"No live lock."

Before anyone settled procedure, Harlow stepped through the line.

"I know this architecture," he said. "Hold perimeter."

He disappeared into the distortion.

Lyra moved to follow. "The Maze keys to my family signature. I'll get to him faster."

The officer hesitated.

Professor Li arrived at a run. "Let her in. Now."

Milo grabbed Lyra's sleeve. She shook him off gently.

"Ten minutes," she said. "If I'm not out, escalate to full breach."

"I hate this plan," Milo said.

"Document that in writing," Eli muttered.

Lyra stepped through the arch.

Inside, the Maze no longer resembled a training environment. Historic latticework had been stripped into active channels, with energy rerouted from multiple layers into one mechanical sink.
The pattern wasn't collapse. Someone had turned the place into intake.

She followed the silver pull through buckling corridors and reached the Animus chamber.

Or what had been the Animus chamber.

A prototype rig sat where the old pedestal had stood: dark core, intake arms, black-silver circulation lines, live draw humming.

Harlow stood at the controls.
Wei Chen lay at his feet, unconscious, signature dim and tearing.

"What are you doing?" Lyra shouted.

"Containment salvage," Harlow said. "The clock already ran out."

"You're draining the Maze. You're draining him."

"He crossed into intake." Harlow did not raise his voice. "System read Chen-line resonance and locked. I can bleed this room now or collect bodies upstairs."

The floor shuddered. A cracked monitor spat red glyphs and an alarm tone that would not settle.

Lyra dropped beside her father and pushed her own pattern against his, trying to keep his field from tearing wider.

"We leave now."

Harlow looked at the rig, then Wei, then Lyra. He keyed shutdown.
Partial disengagement, not full. He still left himself an artery.

As he bent to lift Wei, his sleeve rode up. Fresh thread-burn scars crossed his forearm, inflamed and bright.

"You burned yourself building this," Lyra said.

"Fast harm gives me a list of wounded by dawn," he answered. "Slow collapse gives me a district."

Another tremor hit.
Lyra's silver line opened a narrow route through the collapse, thin as a stitch in split cloth.

"This way," she said.

They half-carried, half-dragged Wei through failing corridors while stone and dead filament rained behind them. Once, Lyra glanced back.

Harlow had torn a compact containment unit free from the rig and tucked it against his ribs like he was smuggling a heart.

They cleared the arch seconds before the entrance collapsed.
Stone sheared downward. Dust and dead light filled the air. The nearest display jumped another tier and went dark with a soft pop.

Medics took Wei.
Milo, Zara, and Eli reached Lyra at the same time, all talking, none coherent.

Harlow stepped into the noise and spoke in his public voice.

"Ms. Chen's family resonance enabled navigation under collapse conditions. We recovered Mr. Chen."

A security officer repeated it into a recorder without looking up.
Two nearby students nodded like the sentence had already been decided for them.
Behind him, the compact containment unit in his hand gave one thin harmonic ping that made Zara flinch.

Lyra met his eyes.
He didn't blink. He didn't soften. He only shifted the unit closer to his ribs and set his thumb over the latch.

Professor Li stared at the smoking ruin.

"Centuries of method for this," she said.

Harlow did not look back at the chamber.
"Write the report," he said. "Start with who came out breathing."

He left before anyone could finish a first question.

Wei was alive on a gurney moving too fast toward the infirmary.
Elara was still missing.
Behind them, the Maze archway was a fresh ruin.

Lyra turned to her friends.

"He just wrote the first version," she said. "If his report lands first, it becomes the version everyone repeats."

Behind them, the emergency bands kept chasing each other around the broken glass.
No one watched them.
Two minutes later, a roof camera that had been "offline for maintenance" clicked awake and began recording.
