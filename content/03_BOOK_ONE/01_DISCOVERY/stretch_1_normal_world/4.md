# Chapter 4: The Invitation

Nai Nai poured jasmine tea and watched Lyra hold the cup with both hands so the tremor had nowhere to hide.

On the table sat three things: Wei's Academy letter, Lin Chen's old sketch satchel, and a jade pendant Lyra had seen only once in childhood.

"Your mother saw what you see," Nai Nai said.

Lyra's pencil stopped.

"Since when did you know?"

"Since your drawings stopped being guesses and started being records."

Nai Nai opened the satchel. Inside were notebooks filled with thread maps, field notes, symbols, and route diagrams: operational documents, not art school exercises.

"Our family called it silk vision," Nai Nai said. "Other traditions use other names. The skill isn't one thing: some hear it, some feel pressure, some see patterns."

She watched Lyra's fingers around the cup.
"No matter how you sense it," Nai Nai said, "you cannot touch without being touched."

She tapped a page from Lin's notes.

*Ask first. Never seize.*

"That line was your mother's argument with half the Academy," Nai Nai said. "They wanted to patent the river and charge by cup. She treated it like kin."
"She wasn't born with an open hand," Nai Nai added. "She practiced until the threads stopped answering her grip and started answering her listening."

"She also added another rule when students started treating curiosity like permission," Nai Nai said. "Thread-silence. If someone asks for it, you don't look."

Lyra turned a page and found a sketch of a mountain campus fed by silver-blue channels.
A handwritten caption: *Threadweaver Academy. Detection network active.*

In the margin, another note: *Beware the Silver Shadow.*

Nai Nai pointed to a layered diagram: city map overlaid with flowing lines that ignored roads.

"The thread dimension isn't elsewhere," she said. "It's braided through this one. Most people move through it without noticing. Seers make it answer when intention has purchase and the room can carry the load."

Lyra touched the jade pendant.
The kitchen folded for one heartbeat: stone steps, carved gate, silver channels running through a facade like veins in glass.
Then the image snapped back hard enough to make her nauseous.
For one breath, she heard boots on cobblestone.

Nai Nai did not look surprised.
"It recognizes you."

"Tell me what happened to Mom," Lyra said.

Nai Nai looked at the letter, not Lyra.
"She prepared evidence for the Thread Council: students used as fuel, forced procedures, and signatures filed under cleaner names."

"And then?"

"She disappeared the night before testimony." Nai Nai folded her hands. "No body. No formal ruling. Only folders gone blank."

Lyra stared at Lin's handwriting until the lines doubled.

"So this invitation isn't random."

"No," Nai Nai said. "It means your profile was detected and escalated."

She slid the Academy letter across the table.

"If you go, go with clear eyes. Learn, but verify."

The front door opened just before dusk.
Wei stepped in, rain on his coat, fatigue visible even before he set down his bag.

He saw the satchel open on the table and stopped.

"You told her."

"Yes," Nai Nai said.

Lyra stood.
"You knew for years and said nothing."

Wei did not defend himself immediately.
He sat, looked at Lin's notebooks, and answered without looking up.

"I knew enough to fear this world, not enough to move in it." He took a breath. "After your mother vanished, I let fear sign every decision in this house."

"It left me blind, on purpose," Lyra said.

"It left me alone too," he said quietly.

Lyra's next argument came up hot and died on her tongue.
Wei kept his eyes on the notebooks, hands flat on the table, holding still to protect the thin truce between them.
Nai Nai paused over the teapot and let the silence do what speeches could not.

Nai Nai broke the silence.
"Decision. Bookstore meeting is Saturday."

Wei nodded once.

"We go together," he said. "We ask hard questions. Nobody takes Lyra anywhere without terms."

Lyra looked at the letter, then at her mother's notes.

"I want answers," she said.

"Then we start there," Nai Nai replied.

She placed the pendant in Lyra's palm.

"Your mother wore this when she was rushing and when she was wrong," Nai Nai said. "Ask first. Keep your hands open. And if you fail, you stay and clean it up."

The pendant warmed in Lyra's hand.
Her first impulse was to close her fist around it.
She forced her fingers open instead.
Outside, rain eased to mist.
Inside, three generations sat at one table with the same problem and no shared language for solving it yet.

Saturday would force one.
