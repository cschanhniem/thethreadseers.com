# Chapter 1: The Bridge

The hallway outside Westbrook High sounded like any other Monday: lockers, sneakers, laughter, somebody dropping a trumpet case.

Lyra kept her head down and sketched in the margins of her notebook while traffic moved around her.
Not faces, not outfits. Load-bearing lines.

Lines appeared when people stood close: threads warm where load was shared, frayed where someone insisted they were fine and quietly handed her the strain.

She had learned, years ago, to call it "pattern" in public and keep the other word to herself.

"Still drawing your ghosts, Chen?" Madison Stone clipped her shoulder on the way past.

Lyra's notebook slipped, pages fanning across the floor.
Katie, a sophomore from art club, knelt first and helped gather them.

"They're good," Katie said quietly, glancing at the page before Lyra could fold it closed. "You always draw people like you know things about them."

The bell rang, and everyone moved. Lyra did too.

In the art room, Ms. Rivera wrote the assignment on the board:

*Relationship Mapping.*
*Draw how people connect, not how they pose.*

Lyra stared at the words, then at Katie and Zach across the room, sitting back to back in deliberate silence.
Their usual bright line looked thin today.

She put charcoal to paper.
As she drew, the line in the air tightened like wire under load.
Not imagination and not metaphor, but a tug behind her ribs, impatient and specific.

She answered it with the small inner pressure she never named out loud and nudged the frayed edge toward center.
The line responded instantly, too clean, like a latch that clicked shut under her thumb.

Katie looked up first.
Zach followed.

"I'm sorry," Katie said.

"Me too," Zach said.
Then he blinked at his own voice, startled. The apology didn't sound like his.

The line between them steadied.
On Lyra's page, the charcoal mark darkened. Lyra hadn't touched it.
Katie smiled, but it arrived late, a fraction behind her own decision. Her hand stayed on the table edge a second too long, feeling for something that was no longer there.
Relief hit first. Then wrongness: thin and metallic, a coin in her palm she hadn't paid for. The line had steadied, but it hadn't chosen to.
By lunch, Katie laughed in all the right places and kept touching her own throat, searching for a missing word.

When class ended, Ms. Rivera stopped her at the door.

"You notice structures other people miss," she said.

"I draw what I see."

"Yes," Rivera said. "I think you do."

That night, Lyra's father texted at 9:14 PM.

*Headache worse. ER to be safe. Don't wait up.*

At 9:36 PM, the hospital called.

By 10:10 she was in a plastic chair beside his bed, listening to monitors, fluorescent hum, and the vending machine in the hall trying to swallow a coin and failing.

Wei Chen looked smaller in hospital light.
His nose had bled through gauze.
His left hand shook once every few seconds even when he held it still.

When he opened his eyes, he looked at her like he had been rehearsing one sentence.

"I'm seeing things," he said. "Shadows at the edge of people. Lines that move when no one moves."

The chair leg squealed when Lyra shifted; she hadn't noticed her knee was bouncing.

He swallowed and tried again.

"It started around the same time your drawings changed."

On the monitor, his pulse skipped and corrected.

Lyra took his hand.
His pulse skipped under her thumb, and her own answered half a beat late.
In her backpack, the sketch from class pressed through thin paper where she'd overworked one point into a dark knot she didn't remember drawing.
The monitor answered with another small, stubborn beep. It kept count while she tried to.
Wei's free hand moved against the sheet in the same rhythm, counting without words as if numbers could brace the room.

She did not have a name for what was happening.
Only a father in a hospital bed, a clock that had stopped pretending to be kind, and the memory of one apology she might have edited by hand.
