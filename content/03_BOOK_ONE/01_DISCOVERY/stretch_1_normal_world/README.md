# Stretch 1: Normal World (Discovery Arc)

## Purpose
Introduce Lyra's early thread perception, establish the family stakes, and set up the invitation into the hidden world.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 1: The Bridge (`1.md`)**: Lyra's perception sharpens at school; Wei's symptoms surface in parallel.
- **Chapter 2: Father's Equations (`2.md`)**: Home pressure and unspoken fear; Lyra and Wei try to stay functional anyway.
- **Chapter 3: Recognition (`3.md`)**: The problem is named between them, and denial stops being an option.
- **Chapter 4: The Invitation (`4.md`)**: Nai Nai frames the family context; the Academy meeting is set.

## Notes
- Keep the voice concrete and lived; avoid jacket-copy summary inside scenes.
