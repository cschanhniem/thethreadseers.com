# Chapter 2: Father's Equations

Two days after the hospital, Wei Chen was back at the kitchen table with tea, papers, and the stubbornness that had built his career.

He said he felt better.
Lyra watched the tremor in his cup and did not argue.

When he lifted the cup, his hand shook hard enough that tea trembled up the rim and left a dark ring on the table.

Lyra's pencil paused.
The line between them tightened, silver not in color but in insistence.
The part of her that wanted to be useful leaned into it before she decided.

The tremor eased.
His fingers steadied for one breath, long enough to drink without spilling.

Wei exhaled like he'd been bracing. "Better," he said, surprised, and took a careful sip.

Warmth rose in Lyra's chest, quick and clean: *I helped.*
Then a faint penny taste touched the back of her tongue, gone if she swallowed fast enough.

Wei stared at his notes.
"I was going to..." He blinked once, searching the air as if the missing word might be hanging there. "The term for it. Never mind."
He wrote a blank line and moved on, like you could leave a space in a sentence and come back later to fill it.

Rain ticked against the window.
She sketched while he worked.

When he leaned over his laptop, she could almost see his thoughts arrange themselves into clean, silver-gray lattices.
When she looked up from her page, she drew the same pattern as curved lines through people, rooms, history.

Same shape, two alphabets, and she never knew which one would keep a person alive.

Wei glanced at her sketchbook.

"You're still on the thread drawings."

"I'm trying to map what changes," Lyra said.

He tapped the table with a knuckle, thinking.
"I don't object to metaphor," he said. "I object when people use it as dosage."

Lyra turned the book so he could see the page: clusters, bridges, breaks, a web that looked like math until you put names on it.

"Your models do this too," she said. "You call it network behavior."

"I call it measurable structure," he replied. "Not perception-driven certainty."

He softened his voice before the next line, but not enough.

"Your mother made the same leap," he said. "Brilliant intuition. Catastrophic timing."

Lyra looked down.
The old argument put on its usual clothes: precise words, unsteady hands.

"Maybe both can be true," she said. "Maybe your model keeps a body standing and mine notices when it limps."

Wei rubbed his temple.
"If your ability is real, then we still need discipline around it. Especially now."

Now meant him: the scans, the headaches, the possibility she was part of the cause.

He stood, gathered his papers, and paused at the doorway.

"Finish grading before dinner," he said, then added, "We'll talk tonight."

After he left, Lyra walked to the one room they never used.

Her mother's studio still smelled faintly of linseed oil and cedar.
The unfinished canvas on the easel had not changed in four years.

On the desk sat a leather journal embossed with a symbol she had begun seeing in her own margins: a central knot with radiating lines.
Beside it lay a silver pendant stamped with the same mark.

When Lyra touched the cover, a low pressure gathered in her palm, followed by a brief rush of sensory fragments that were not in the room:
stone, cold air, metal railings, a carved doorway, a name she almost heard before it vanished.

She opened the first page.
Her mother's hand.
Thread sketches annotated in two languages.
One line in English underlined twice:

*Threads answer intention. Force frays them; relationship steadies them.*

The front door opened.
Lyra shut the journal too fast and turned off the studio light.

For one disloyal second she imagined saying she had never seen it, locking the studio, choosing ordinary.
The relief was immediate. So was the shame.

Wei stood in the kitchen holding a thick cream envelope with an embossed seal.

He looked from the envelope to her face and understood more than she said.

"This came from Threadweaver Academy," he said.

Lyra did not speak.

"Informational meeting at Iris Bookstore. Saturday." He set the envelope on the table between them. "Your grandmother is listed as a contact."

Even the refrigerator hum ducked under the words.

"You knew," Lyra said.

Wei sat down slowly.
"I knew enough to be afraid. Not enough to help."

He pushed the envelope toward her.

"Read it," he said. "Then talk to Nai Nai before we decide anything. She understood your mother better than I did."

Lyra picked up the letter; the seal warmed against her thumb.

Whatever this was, it had stopped being private.
