# Chapter 3: Recognition

The Academy invitation stayed on Lyra's desk for two days and two bad nights, face up like a witness.

Cream paper, embossed seal, careful typography; a polite envelope built to do one impolite thing: single her out.

She tried algebra. She tried sketching fruit bowls and doorway studies and anything without people in it.
Every page ended in bridges, breaks, and one knot she kept shading darker than the rest.

Through the wall, her father moved around his study in stop-start passes.
Cabinet. Desk. Sink. Cabinet again.
His line felt thinner by the hour, stretched and stubborn, like wire that had decided not to snap in front of her.

He coughed once, twice, and the bond between them tugged like a thread caught under a door.

Lyra set her pencil down.
Without getting up, without touching anything but air, she pressed that small inner pressure again, the way she'd pressed in the art room.
Not a grab. Not force. Just a nudge toward steadier.

The cough eased.
On the other side of the wall, Wei's breathing went smoother for three counted beats.

Relief warmed her palms.
Then came the faint metallic hint again, like she'd licked a coin by accident.

Wei said, muffled, "Where's my..."
Silence.
"Never mind," he added, the sentence arriving too flat.

She picked up her phone, opened Nai Nai's contact, closed it, opened it again.

Calling meant admitting the same thing she had avoided naming all week:
Katie and Zach had apologized because she had leaned on something she did not understand.
It wasn't a metaphor anymore. It was method.

She pressed call before she could talk herself into another lie.

It rang once.

"Come tomorrow before lunch," Nai Nai said. Receiver already in hand. "Bring the letter. And bring the drawing you don't want to show me."

Lyra looked down at the page under her hand.

"How did you..."

"Because your mother asked that exact question at sixteen," Nai Nai said. "You can ask it over tea."

The line clicked dead, gentle and final.

For a minute Lyra sat in the dark with the phone still in her palm, listening to her father's cough through the wall and the faint scrape of his chair as he pretended work was the same as control.
