# Epilogue

## Purpose
Show repair as maintenance: what changes immediately, what changes slowly, and what kind of world this becomes if the characters keep choosing process over spectacle.

## Sections
- **ONE WEEK LATER (`epilogue.md`)**: The Nexus Concord ritual, survivor accounting, and institutional reforms that outlive the crisis.
- **FIFTEEN YEARS LATER (`epilogue.md`)**: The long view on governance, education, and the quartet's adult lives.

## Notes
- Keep reforms specific and operational; avoid vague "and then everything healed" summary language.
